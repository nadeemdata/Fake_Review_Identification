Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,Putting on these socks made my feet very happy! Right when I took them out of the package I could feel how soft and well made they were and when I put them on my feet that was immediately confirmed. They are extremely comfortable and the fit is perfect. I always prefer to buy quality socks that come in different sizes. I have somewhat small feet (8 1/2 mens) and those one size fits all socks you get in department stores never fit me right. The heels always seem to ride up the back of my ankle which is very annoying. With these socks the size medium fits and hugs my feet perfectly and the fabric feels great against my skin. I have no doubt that anyone else who tries these socks on will love them as much as I do! I was very lucky to receive these great socks at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.

I use then only for training sessions and purchasing the variety pack has broken up the monotony of having to use one flavor.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"They are good quality and I think the price was a good deal. I also like the new hex key adjustment built into the thumbscrew. A couple of things worried me a little. The 10"" strait jaw and long nose pliers have a bit of play, side-to-side, in the jaw and they don't necessarily align perfectly when you close them; there is no play at all when they are closed. I'm not sure this really even matters, but it bothers me. On the other hand, I'm not sure I've ever seen long nose locking pliers, old or new, that didn't have a little wobble in the open jaw.
All of the curved jaw pliers are fine, so I'm giving them  a four over the two loose jaws."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,"This item was pretty easy to assemble and the materials are good. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very hard to find, so you have to buy a new one. I would definitely buy this again. I bought this to replace a broken one I had. I love the color and the fact that the hose is a little longer than I expected. This one has a nice white finish. I like that the hose is longer than the one I had. The hose has a small, rubber ring that helps keep it clean."

I tightened it up,but it slid on the seat a little,so I put a zip tie around the front narrow part of the seat. That made it stay in place really good.

makes another unique story and realistic reading. DeMille continues to
provide great dialog, emotionally interesting characters and suspense

Electronics_5,1,"I bought this for a few reasons, 1) it is a nice piece of equipment, and 2) it works very well. Pros:
-Highly adjustable angle
-The angle is adjustable and adjusts to your head. -This lens is excellent. -It is a bit smaller than I expected it to be. -It is a little heavier than I expected. -It has a nice depth of field. -It is very light. -I like the quality of the mount. -The lenses are very well built. Cons:

Kindle_Store_5,0,"A standalone read with a HEA, no cliffhanger.  Denton works for his father as an enforcer on collecting money owed.  He also is a CEO of his own business.  He helped out a friend, Kara, by hiring her to be his PA.  Kara is killed and he is hellbent on getting revenge on her killer(s), whoever they are.

Chloe is a newly graduated FBI agent working her first undercover case.  She comes in as a replacement for Kara as Denton's PA.  She is all for bringing Denton and his father down and arresting them, especially since her father was on the bad side of a loan shark.

What Chloe didn't count on was falling for Denton.  Denton doesn't want to fall for Chloe but he does as well.

Overall I really enjoyed the story, but when Denton finds out the Chloe was an FBI agent and was set on bringing him down, I found it almost hard to believe that he forgave her that easily.  I mean he beat up his friend on his father's orders but forgave Chloe for being an FBI agent almost immediately.  Liked the little plot twist towards the end (no spoilers).

I would recommend this as a quick read.  The characters were thought out and the story flowed well.

I was given an ARC copy in exchange for an honest review."

I used them to hold metric and SAE open end, open end ring (combination) and ring spanners and found they tidied up my tool box leaving much more room and making the tools identifiable at a glance. You can cut them to fit and I found a small band saw did the best job but a sharp blade would work as well. I highly recommend these."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,"Here are just some of the things you can do to help keep your hands clean.

- Remove the top of the plastic cap.  The plastic cap is so thin it's barely noticeable.  If you have a large head, it might be OK to remove the plastic cap.  If your head is larger, it might be OK to remove the plastic cap.
- Remove the plastic cap from the handle.  The handle is too large for a small head.  The plastic cap is too small for a small head.
- Remove the plastic cap from the handle.  The plastic cap is too small for a small head.  The plastic cap is too small for a small head.

The plastic cap is made of thin plastic.  I've had it for a few months now and the plastic cap is still holding good.  If you need to remove the plastic cap, you'll have to buy a different plastic cap.  Just make sure you have a small, clean plastic cap.

I'm always checking the price of products and would recommend this product to anyone.

One thing to keep in mind is that the plastic cap is not made of plastic.  It is made of a plastic material, which means it's not solid.  If it falls off, you can still get a plastic cap.  But if you try to remove the plastic cap, it might be OK to remove the plastic cap.  I would suggest you do this because the plastic cap is so thin, so you can easily get a plastic cap.  This is a good idea"
Movies_and_TV_5,0,"THis was my FAVORITE show as a kid so I was thrilled when they released the first season on dvd. I never get tired of watching this show, I loved the extras with commentary and the special or whatever you call it on the one disc, I was a little disappointed that there were not more extras cause I like the extras on the dvds. Seeing what Lynda Carter looks like today was really neat and to hear her talk about her experience on Wonder Woman was a treat. Get this dvd if your a fan of this show-you'll be glad you did!"

Electronics_5,0,Got this for Christmas last year. Had 2 6.5s and a bridged 12 hooked up. Ran 0 gauge from battery and ground and 12g to speakers. Worked well for about 6 months. Around July or August it started having issues channels failing in an odd way. Any amp Ive had in the past that has gone bad the channel stayed dead. It developed a whine in one speaker and then channels would randomly cut out until you turned it off for a few minutes and back on again. This would cut out in one channel one day and another on a different day. Rechecked wiring and all is good. Distortion is bad at higher volumes and bass is very muffled. For the price it sounded as expected and for the time it did work it worked ok. I did expect it to last longer than it did.

It is in English, which is one of the most important languages in the world.  The English translation is also the most beautiful, and the ending is very moving.  I will say that the story of the film is pretty accurate.  I have a hard time understanding how they could have done this in English, so I will leave it at that.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"The stated dimensions on the description are overstated in the usable space of the bag. I find the outside of the bag alone are 7.5 x 6.75 x 3. That being said the bag is still large enough for most anything you need in a hurry. Definitely enough for a very comprehensive first aid kit. I use mine for a possible bag instead. It has metal D rings attached to the back that hold a shoulder strap and enough organization room inside for all your essentials. There is enough webbing on the outside to mount any extra things you might need. Mine holds an extra knife and tomahawk. I have the platform mounted to my hunting ruck or go pack then I just peel the bag off, deploy the shoulder strap, and I am off. The zippers are nice mid duty and covered. Covered enough to ward off dust and debris and light water. Dont get me wrong it is nowhere near waterproof but the covering adds some resistance. The mounting platform comes with retaining straps to secure the bag from accidental loss if the Velcro should fail. All the webbing on the inside of the bag is elastic minus the retaining strap for the pockets allowing you to secure your load without having it rattle around. Overall very nice bag.

Kindle_Store_5,0,"I loved the story of Sam and Chloe (or Same and Chloe if one of the typos wasn't a typo). It was a story of a long lasting love that just needed the right timing. Sam finally gets tired of waiting and hauls his lady back home to Texas where they build on  their relationship. The story was great and fairly well done. The supporting characters were a nice touch. Typos still abound with words that are poorly chosen (always spelled correctly but the wrong word in the sentence) and things that don't make sense. The winner for this novel - a car that becomes a truck then goes back to being a car, like the transformers children play with but in this case I think the author forgot what kind of vehicle she had Sam driving. As usual, I liked this enough to suggest others make the purchase. My less than perfect rating is still due to the fact that a proofreader is truly needed. Enjoy."
Books_5,0,"I guess at this point it is grind out as many Patterson books as possible as fast as you can to make a killing. Well I got this from the library, thank someone!! The killer (paid assassin  called the Ghost) is painted in such a way that you just have to forgive him. There is murder, murder, murder, but her they are all bad guys. The Ghost is at once smart and dumb... that he lives through the book is only due to the fact that he is fictional. I skimmed several chapters just to get to the ending, and believe me you could skim the entire book and not miss any literary gems. Very disappointing. Robert Parker, where are you?

The happy times, fun times, how Amish families interact, times of hope, and times of despair. I found myself immersed in the story and mesmerized by the Amish lifestyle. I can't wait to read the next book and see how things unfold. This book was provided to me for this review through the Blogging for Books program of WaterBrook Press. The opinions, however, are entirely my own!

I still remember reading his work, especially his ""The Key to the Universe.""  I think it's a good read, especially if you are a child.  I've heard of David H. Lawrence, but I think I am more likely to be interested in his other works.  I highly recommend this book.I enjoyed this book.

Books_5,0,"Koontz in ""The Husband"" reinvented the definition of a quick read. Read first 20 pages and then the last 20 pages and that's pretty much all you'll need to get the most out of this chicanery.

The book's cover describes an ""earth-shattering"" climax. Reviewers talk about a ""hair-raising"" thriller. Did the standards of the book publishing sink so low that anybody who may have previously published something worthy can now pretty much sell mule's crap to the public by slapping a colorful bow on it and labeling it an ""earth-shattering"" droppings?

Yes, the book starts out just as advertised. But then quickly goes down-hill from there. Koontz did not spend enough time on the characteristics of his protagonist Mitch Rafferty and his wife Holly so that readers connect with them and sustain the nerve-racking feeling from beginning to the end. My pulse quickly dropped after first 20 pages. My hair never raised and as I was reading the climax scene there was no earth movement.

I am sure the movie is coming soon too. If this happens then my hair will surely rise to the occasion."

The only thing I would change is that the backlight on the case was very bright.  I don't know if it was a bad design or just the case, but I would not recommend this case.  I wish it had a window.  I don't have a window on this case, but I don't know if it will work in my future.This is a good product.  It looks great and works great.

Movies_and_TV_5,0,"""The Facts of Life"" is one of those great television shows that defined the 80s. It had comedy but easily tackled issues young people were facing such as drugs, sex, and simply morals and things like self-esteem.

This DVD release does what few first season sets don't; it packs in two seasons, includes some actually good extras that includes interviews with some key cast members, and simply gives the fans of the show what they wanted. The transfer to DVD seems okay or decent. The extras, as mentioned, were good ... they included interviews of some of the women who played the girls in the first season (and made a few appearances in season 2).

I didn't remember the show being as funny and engaging as it was from the start into the second season when the cast was downsized and focused on a select few. The writing wasn't too cheesey and the plots were fresh and still are today. This is one of those shows, and DVD releases, that I'd have to say is a ""must own."" This was a piece of television history when T.V. wasn't loaded down with reality shows and poor shows. Get this show on DVD, you won't be disapointed."

The story's main character, Paris, is the host of a late night radio show.  Besides playing music, she also gives her callers advice.  When a caller asks advice about her love life, Paris tells her to drop her loser boyfriend, who also happens to be one of Paris's normal callers.  This turns out to be bad advice, as the dumped boyfriend decides to abduct her.  This is the start of an incoherent story involving an old flame of Paris, whose son is involved with a sex club website that the abducted girl's father runs.  Yes, it's about as silly as I described.  The book is not well written, not remotely memorable.  I would recommend passing on this novel.

I sprayed a lottle last evening with it to test it out. It came with a fine wire strainer on the pickup tube. The cup is thin and should be treated carefully. There is no reinforcing base ring like most high quality cups. It sealed easy and the quick connect worked well. Good cheap cup.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,1,"I usually don't write reviews, but I thought the review was a little misleading. I was just a little surprised at the quality. The material is soft, and the inside is very comfortable. I have had no issues with the fit, and it's not very see through. The shoe is a bit too tight for me to wear, but I'll try it on a few times. I'm just hoping that the heel portion of the shoe will loosen up after a few wearings. Overall, I'd say it's a good shoe, but I'm not sure how long it'll last. I've had a few pairs of shoes that have been too tight, and these are the only ones I've found that have lasted me at least a full season. I've had a few pairs of this brand, and I think I've found some that do. I'm still waiting on a return, but I'm sure I'll find a better shoe, and I'm going to try them on next time I'm wearing them. UPDATE: I've been wearing these shoes for a couple weeks now, and they seem to be working well."

The island itself is a great place to read, and it is not in the same league as the rest of the Island.

I read about 20 boring, annoying pages over the course of four days, and then picked up an Agatha Christie, which took me a day to finish.  I just don't think this was well-written, and I don't mean the translation.  I mean the narrative.  Fiction 101 tells a writer to SHOW, NOT TELL.  Instead of making there be anything vivid, let alone convincing, about these people or the pathos of the situation, Larsson tells tells tells.  Additionally, as many have commented, Larsson spends so much time in exposition, there is no forward momentum.  As stated, I couldn't go beyond 20 pages."

Books_5,0,"I enjoyed reading Tuesdays with Morrie.  The book is a sportswriter's account of how his old, favorite college professor deals with getting ALS, a fatally, progressive neurological disease.  It's a moving story, even though you can pretty much guess how it ends up.  It reads very quickly and is not long, any longer and it may have become tedious.

It appears that the story is true, possibly written during a newspaper writer's strike several years ago.  The real hooker for the story is hearing what Morrie feels is important in life and how to live it.  Even though his own life is coming to a close, Morrie seems to still enjoy being alive, though there is also some denial.  Ablom and his professor, Morrie, met on Tuesday's.

In another way I think the book is very valuable.  Morrie points out that there is actually an advantage of dying an agonizingly slow death--it gives him the time to say what he has to say and do what has to be done.  As a physician who frequently deals with patients and families who confront death, I was refreshed by this insight.  It's the exact opposite of what we all wish for, a quick and painless death."

By the way - much less expensive to buy this online instead of Petsmart - (As if you did not know already otherwise you would not be shopping here).
One pass over your friendly feline, and it will already have a ton of hair.  I like to sit with my kitty in my lap - and by the time I am done brushing her - I usually have another cat.  (Or at least, I could have another one).
Since using this product, I have had to deal with less hairballs, and less shedding in general.  It keeps the fur under control.  Really like this brush - easy to use - and the kitty loves it too."

I have used it for about three months now and it is all scratched up and looks pretty bad.

I didn't want to spend the money for it and now I have one that I don't have to buy again. I hope the new one will last a while and it will last a long time. The silver ones are good quality and they have been in my bathroom for a long time. I like the fact that I can see them in the bathroom and they are not too big or too small. I would have liked to have the metal ones but now that I have them I don't really know how long they will last. I don't use them in the shower. I just rinse them out. I do wish the bags were a little bigger but I don't really care for them. They are nice and heavy and they fit well in my bathroom. I also like the fact that they are plastic and I can wash them at the sink and not worry about their being in the dishwasher. I also like that they have a small plastic brush that helps to help with drying. The quality is good and the colors are good. I would highly recommend this product. Works great, but not as good as I expected. I'd buy again."
Kindle_Store_5,0,"Well--appears Fiona Gavelle is up to her legal antics again.  And her writer, Una Tiers, is up to her tricks again, delivering yet another page-turner with ""Not Safe for the Bank(er)"".

Ms Tiers calls it a short story.  I would bicker with that classification and call it, rather, a novella, or, a short novel.  It provides all the satisfaction one receives from a work that is longer than a short story, in that allows for a fuller development of character, and a plot that can be more convoluted with considerably more back story.

Fiona Gavelle was introduced in ""Judge vs. Nuts"" as a newbie attorney solving a murder mystery while stumbling and tripping her way through a legal system that doesn't favor the still innocent and idealistic attorney in her dealings with the ""good ol' boys"" of the bar.

In this book, we get the feeling that Fiona, thank goodness, still hasn't lost her innocence and idealism while doing the leg work for her client-by-default, Mr. Fives.  (You'll have to read it to find out just how he fell in her lap--but it's an enjoyable challenge).

Between the first book and this one there is a perceptible growth and maturity in the character of Fiona Gavelle.  But it is refreshing to rediscover that the revolving door still can slap her in the butt.

You're gonna love ""Not Safe for the Bank(er)""!"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"Another great, high quality rug I own from Norcho. I love this company! They are great to work with, have wonderful customer service and their rugs are a beautiful addition to our home. We received this awesome animal zoo print one and have places it beside our little girl, Giselle's bed! She has been loving it! It is so fun for her to be able to enjoy the comfort of the rug and use it as a useful learning too while she is beginning to learn how to identify different animals. This rug depicts a hippo, a camel, an elephant and our personal favorite...a giraffe! We actually had a bit of a scare in the middle of the night the other day, when Giselle was sleeping too close to the edge of her bed and accidentally fell to the floor. Luckily for us, we had this rug laid down so it helped tremendously to break her fall. It is very thick and cushioned, so she was able to brace the impact on her head and body! Ironic, but it we felt the rug was meant to be there for her. I will continue to order items from this company in the future! * I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion *"
Movies_and_TV_5,0,"""Batman Begins"" is impressive! Christian Bale is excellent as Bruce Wayne / Batman. Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman, and Gary Oldman led a solid supporting cast that has Katie Holmes, Cillian Murphy, Tom Wilkinson, Rutger Hauer, and Ken Watanabe in it. Christopher Nolan's directing is impressive. The screenplay by Nolan and David S. Goyer (who also wrote the Blade Movies) and the story by Goyer is brilliant. The music by James Newton Howard & Hans Zimmer is very impressive. The cinematography (Oscar nominated) by Wally Pfister is excellent. The film editing by Lee Smith is excellent. The casting by John Papsidera & Lucinda Syson is excellent. The production design by Nathan Crowley is very impressive. The art direction by Peter Francis, Stuart Kearns, Paul Kirby, Simon Lamont, Steven Lawrence, David Lee, Patrick Lumb, Shane Valentino, Su Whitaker is very impressive. The set decoration by Paki Smith is very impressive. The costume design by Lindy Hemming is very impressive. This is one of the year's best and one of the best comic book movies in recent history since ""Spider-Man 2"" (2004)."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"I received this tool as a gift. It is well made and very useful, especially with trim molding and almost anything that requires an angle on the sliding miter saw. However, the scale was misaligned by one full degree. I called Starrett and was told that their tolerance for this tool is +/- one degree. That is unacceptable from a company like Starrett renowned for their  precision. I exchanged the tool for another, hand selected from inventory, and found one just .1 degree misaligned after looking at a dozen or so. This is workable accuracy but IMO the tool should be engraved, and the scale should be accurate or the scale should be eliminated. The decal itself may be accurate but the application process seems to produce a fair number of these tools with misaligned scales. With a sliding miter saw this is not really a problem as you can just transfer the angle. But, if the scale is there it should be accurate or at least installed properly. With the scale accuracy problems it rates three stars. If the scale were properly installed and accurate, I would give it 5 stars. Then I would not have to use my engraved Starrett protractor to read the actual angle when needed."
Electronics_5,1,"On my Nikon D5300 with a lens hood and a hooded lens hood, I noticed that the front edge of the lens hood was a bit softer than the hooded lens hood. This is because the hooded lens hood is designed to allow for better light and better sharpness. The hooded lens hood is also designed to provide a better grip on the lens.

I also noticed that my lens hood was not able to hold the lens in the case that I was holding. This was due to the lens hood not having enough space for the lens hood.

I was able to remove the hood from the lens hood and place it in the case."

Electronics_5,0,"Mounted this on the back of my 32 foot camper. Used their 50 foot extension cable and mounted the transmitter on the front of the camper. It takes a couple of seconds for the GPS to switch to the backup camera, but after my 3 and 1/2 week vacation that we just got back from, and about 3000 miles, this thing saved my butt several times.  It allowed me to turn my rig around in places I would not dare to do with out this camera, as it was to dangerous for the rig and anyone to go out to guide me back. The camera is a fish eye, so mounted at a 45 degree angle, I can see the whole back of my camper, and up into the sky, and several car widths to both sides of the back of my camper.  I was also amazed at how you can adjust the guide lines to fit your rig, raise them up, down, and spread them apart or closer together so they perfectly fit your use.  If want, you can remove the guide lines with a simple checkmark in my GPS, but with being able to adjust them so much, I would not know why anyone would want to turn them off.  I use this with the Garmin RV 770 LMT-S.  For a camper or truck, this is the most awesome GPS I have ever owned, and matched with this camera, its simply indispensable."

Movies_and_TV_5,0,"Saw Jaws in 75' when I was 7 and then Grizzly came out in 76', the time was about 6-8 months between these two films and it was plain to see this movie was a cash in on the killer animal craze that ran through the mid to late 70s starting with the famous Spielburg film. Stars Christopher George as the park ranger , Richard Jaeckel as a naturalist and Andrew Prine as a vietnam vet running a helicopter service. A 18 foot two thousand pound grizzly goes on the rampage taking out campers , a couple of park rangers before coming to the final showdown with the George character who instead of a scuba tank uses a Lors rocket launcher to destroy the bear. I still enjoy watching it after all these years could have given it 5 stars but that might be pushing it a bit to far. This 2 disc edtion is far better than a earlier version I brought. Remastered with interviews with cast members , trailers and photo gallery shots. I found the interviews with the 2005 screening of the film a bit odd as these people seemed to be on another planet to me but all in all a well made and put together edtion."

Books_5,0,"I loved the fever series and have been waiting for over a year now for the new book to come out and it's finally here! Read it, loved it and am wanting more! The only thing I don't like is that Dani is only 14 and way too young to have the smoldering sexual tension that Mac and Barrons had. I hope the next book in the series fast forwards a few years! I don't think I can wait for her to turn a respectable age before she finally loses her V-card to...who will it be? Dancer, Christian or Ryodan? Hmmmm the possibilities! I hope Karen Marie Moning doesn't wait a year to release the next book in the series!"

So, they send him into the mutant reserve to rescue the harem he is supposed to use to repopulate the country with, so they can rearm and destroy the 'enemy', ostensibly the Soviets.

Most people who have seen the orginal and enjoyed it shouldn't even try to watch a re-make, not just for this film but any because no matter how good it was they'll hate it. I have to say I enjoyed all the re-makes so far. ""The Grudge""; ""One Missed Call"" and so on and so forth. I also like these because I haven't seen the org: The movie is worth watching."

Pet_Supplies_5,0,"Having shopped for more expensive dog booties, we were pleasantly surprised by how well these have worked.

Big Pluses:
1. easy on and off
2. our dog got used to them in just a few days of short walks (man was this funny at first)
3. stayed on as long as they were pretty tightly snugged up, in terms of the velcro
4. totally did the job of protecting her feet.

Note that we used these while backpacking for a week in Colorado. You could use these around town, but in my experience dog feet can toughen up quite a bit with regular walking.

Anyway: good booties."

If you have a larger head (like me), the earbuds can get a little tight when you get used to them.

They are good for a small size.I bought this to replace a broken one I bought for my TV. I did not want to have to replace it since the TV was so cheap. It works fine and seems to last for quite a while. It's very easy to use and holds the TV securely. The only con I've noticed is that it doesn't feel like a piece of plastic and the speaker is a bit flimsy. But I do like it. I'll be returning it.I got this to replace an older wall wart that was a bit of a pain to remove.  This little stick works fine for the price and I would recommend it.Works great on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 3.  I use it to hold my Nexus 7 tablet in a desk and it works great.  I use it on my tablet with the tablet's audio jack on it.  The only drawback is that it is a little hard to set up and I can't see where it will fit.  I don't have any problems with it.  I would recommend it for those who use their tablet for gaming or watching movies on the go.I bought this because it works great for my macbook pro.

Kindle_Store_5,0,I received this ARC for an honest review.  Sometimes step-sibling books can very a little predictable and follow a strong similar story line.  This one was pushed up a notch and was varied in its outline with characters that showed their true colors along the way.  A good read and a pleasant change.
Books_5,0,"Love, Lucy was a great book that I read along with my friends. There is travel, romance, college life, and self-discovery. I liked seeing Italy through Lucy's eyes and falling in ""something"" with Jesse Palladino. He definitely is crush-worthy.

One of my favorite terms from Love, Lucy was ""vacation flirtation"" - referring to the quick romance you experience while on vacation. This sounds like something my best friend and I would have termed.

I liked this story so much. There were times that I wanted more development, more answers to questions that I had about secondary characters, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Five Things I Want to Do After Reading Love, Lucy

  1. Travel abroad. This is a given. Grab a backpack and go!
  2. Watch Roman Holiday. Lucy mentions it a few times and recreates a scene for a picture. I've never seen it and now I want to.
  3. Read A Room with a View by E.M. Forster. Love, Lucy is an adaptation
  4. Watch a live musical. Or maybe just sing along loudly to a musical soundtrack.
  5. Read more books by April Lindner."
Electronics_5,0,"I highly recommend this case. Especially if you use your phone for things like watching video, reading documents and such.
The case is very protective at the corners which is where a phone gets most damage.
The two features i love are the standing slot and the auto on. Whenever you open the case the screen automatically turns on. This feature doesnt waste any battery and it saves you if your power button is losing. you don't even have to latch it everytime, I only latch it when i put it in my pocket. Normally i just let the cover down until the latch is resting on the edge and it shuts the screen off.
The inside is very soft and won't scratch the screen and the outside feels great.
Nothing i can find wrong with it except i wish it covered the edges of the phone more like it does the corners."

""The Last Man on Earth"" is a two part series about the last man on Earth, a man who is in his late twenties and early fifties.  The story is told in a rather idyllic setting with no real name or place to call it, but the characters and the plots are so convincing that it is easy to understand why they chose to go to the location.  It's very refreshing to see the characters in action, and the setting is absolutely gorgeous, with colorful scenery, great music, a great musical score and a beautiful soundtrack that doesn't detract from the story.

The only problem I had with this series was that the ""top of the range"" prices for the sets were a bit high, which is a shame because I really liked the show.  As far as the movies go, I enjoyed the first ""The Last Man on Earth"" and the ""The Last"

Toys_and_Games_5,0,"This game is very creative, i will give it that. The components are lacking. The little black clips slide around and make it hard for gameplay, as most of us don't remember how many points we have on the cards. One member of our group used some pieces of note card to pad under the clips, it helped if you don't feel like replacing the parts.
It's a good game to play with 6 people, although it does take seemingly forever to get to your turn again (i was always the last player to go, so it didn't help).
I wish i wasn't a visual learner sometimes, because when people read off their cards it's a bit hard to follow, but i just asked for the card to be passed around the group if there was nothing ""secret"" on it.
With six people playing it can take 3 hours of playtime, depending on how the game goes. We got this for our D&D group for when some players cannot show up but we still want to play something. However, with how much of a hit it was in the group, we may have to start another night for playing just this game!.

On the plus side, I have used it for 18 months with no problems other than the slow toasting. And the slots will take large bagel halves. But I'm done with it. Ordering the Cuisinart CPT-180 today."

Electronics_5,0,"Potentially good earphones with two major issues. I can rate them 2.5 to 3 stars based on the units I received.
First of all, the construction quality is really good. Buttons, earbuds, cables, eartips - everything is made of very good quality. The aluminium case is another pleasant bonus.
Speaking of sound quality, it's good but not great. I felt the bass is weak even after tweaking equalizer on my laptop as well as phone. Audio (especially music) feels little flat as compared to other earphones I tested. Having said that, it doesn't mean it's bad and is surely acceptable for daily use. The volume controls operate individually (independent of source volume) so that's a very good feature. Range is very good. I didn't notice audio breaking while walking away from source unless I went too far. As compared to other earphones I've tested, these have larger bluetooth range.
Two major issues these earphones have are battery life and in-ear fit. In-ear fit is not quite good. It keeps falling off the ears even after trying all eartips and earfins. I found mid-sized eartips better fitting than others. It's certainly manageable when you are doing a desk top and not moving around much. They fell off once when I was walking around in office. Battery life is the biggest disappointment. The earphones get fully charged in less than 2 hours (as is the case with most of other earphones) but I got ""battery level medium"" audio prompt within first half hour of use. I used then for another 40 minutes and I got ""battery low"" prompt and within few minutes they switched off as battery was completely off. So I could use them for less than 1.5 hours after fully charging them. I'm not sure if the battery issue is by design or if the units I received have this defect.
Conclusion - These earphones surely have potential but aforementioned two major issues disappoint you. If they at least had good battery life, they surely deserve 4.5 stars."
Books_5,0,I read this book years ago and I still find myself talking about it and recommending to friends. It is a wonderful story and reminds us that not everyone sat by and did nothing during the holacaust. Many people risked their lives to do the right thing. I recommend this book highly.

Kindle_Store_5,0,I loved this book I started reading while I was at work and then continued when I got home and before I knew it it was 5am.  It is a love story that really fits in this day and age especially with the way things are going in today's times.  The Dr has an affair with the office manager and his wife moves to a small town and she finds the love of her life.  The small town contractor is down on love till he meets the new lady that has moved to town and he goes from playboy to loverboy without even realizing it.
Books_5,0,"I thought this would be more of a recipe book.  It is a guide (packed with scientific info) on women's health, women's bodies, and women's weight issues and explains why we women are very different from men.  There is a lot of information, it's a big book.  But I think the science is important and worth knowing.  For example, why is it easier for men to lose weight?  How do hormones affect out bodies and our weight issues?

So, once you get past the super-interesting science of women's health and bodies, there is a 3 week plan for changing eating habits.  It isn't like a diet book in that there aren't TONS of recipes, more like example recipes so a woman can structure her own diet in a healthy way.  There are no photos.

Recipes look good but some of them, by famous chefs especially, are complicated with many ingredients and many steps.  If that's your thing, you'll like it.

I found the book informative and helpful.  I am going to try the breakfast changes first.  I like understanding how my body works differently from a man's and how that changes how I should go about eating and taking care of myself.

Very good, informative book for readers who like a lot of information."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"Oxbow is the brand I rely on to most generally always give me the best quality Timothy Hay for my guinea pigs.  It generally has all green in its stalks and seeds.

Her clever, thoughtful, and well-laid plot really hooks you in, and the characters are so heart-felt that I truly felt I knew them by the end. The resolution was quite satisfying. Highly recommended for anyone, but most especially for thinking readers who like a challenging puzzle (and where the author gives them all the pieces they need to solve the puzzle right along with the characters.) ..."
Movies_and_TV_5,0,"My secret pleasure, watching the world get destroyed. '2012' has whacky characters, I love Yellowstone blowing up and the DJ broadcasting it live, a strong compassionate black president, oddly constructive so you're kept guessing as to what the govs are up to, some realism about 'who' would get picked to survive, and lots of visual images of crumbling various national landmarks. A fun movie for the disaster film fanatic."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"I ordered one of these curious about the comparison to the Honeywell product.  If you haven't noticed (by reading the reviews) this is not the same product that Honeywell delivers with their air filtration unit.

The filter that came with my unit was a bit stiffer in construction when compared to this replacement filter but, I'm fairly confident that this replacement will provide similar performance.  It is identically sized, and seems to have the same filtration capabilities (or darn close) to the actual Honeywell product.

I'll order this again, and feel confident in suggesting that you give it a chance."

A good review is needed in order to give us a better understanding of the story.  I will say this.  The story is based on a true story of a man who went into the hospital and died after being attacked by a group of people.  His mother, who lived in the hospital and was very ill, went to see him.  He was attacked by a group of people and was later taken to a hospital.  He was then treated and eventually released.  He was a well-known personality and he was released.  He was a very popular character.  The story is very well told and the actors are very good.  He was a very"

Kindle_Store_5,0,"Ive decided to retire to Marietta and get a permanent ringside seat to all the excitement that seems to grace this little enchanting town. Bachelor auctions, hot cowboys, unsuspecting love weaving magic, and the essence of romance filling the air is just perfect, as these potpourri of authors create love stories around these wonderful people.

The second book in the Montana Born Brides brings out His Blushing Bride Piper Tierney even as Sebastian Bloom wants to fight his feelings for her. On a break from his doctorate program, Bastian comes to Marietta to attend his sisters wedding and ends up falling head over heals for the shy and blushing Piper.

Taking over from her father, Piper is the music teacher in Marietta High. Born with a birthmark on her face and having endured childhood teasing and bullying, Piper maybe a successful and beautiful, but her history with the opposite sex has a lot of learning to be done. And Sebastian charms her pants off and they fall into an affair that is supposed to be temporary or can Bastian convince Piper into becoming the next Marietta bride?

Dani Collins writes some really sweet love stories. I loved the fact that she gave her heroine a flaw that could happen to anyone. I admire the way she made Piper into this strong and independent woman, yet vulnerable and sensitive, wanting to be loved for who she is, a beauty inside out. And this beautiful lady sends Bastian into an emotional roller coaster as he tries to fathom his feeling for Piper and convince her of his love being genuine and permanent.

Another charming romance in the town of Marietta, and its always so very wonderful to revisit characters from the previous stories.

Electronics_5,0,"This unit was good for a bit.  The overall construction needs reworked as after only two weeks the stand snapped off, broke, not to be repaired or refitted.  The shell itself is of nice material to absorb impact during a fall.  Ok for the price but needs to be re-engineered to put a better quality stand on it."
Books_5,1,"I was hesitant to read this book, as it seemed too preachy for my taste. I wasn't impressed. I liked the story and the characters, but it was boring. The author seemed to be trying to get the reader to love her characters. The writing style seemed a bit too choppy and choppy. There was a lot of dialogue and the story didn't quite get to the heart of it. It was like a well-written story that was written in a very short time. I liked the ending and it was nice to see a hero come back and save the world. The characters were too likable and the story was just too much like a story to me. I loved the ending and didn't like the ending at all. I don't know if I'd have read it again if I wasn't so absorbed in the story. I really did like the ending. I read the story for a week and it just did not seem worth it. I would recommend this to anyone. I've read all of the James Patterson books. I've enjoyed the first one a lot and loved the last one."

The only reason I ordered this is because I had a lot of leftover junk in the wallet, so I decided to return it.

I will be using it for a few years and see how it holds up.

I will also add the fact that I had to replace one of the pockets with this one because I didn't want to put the items on the counter.

This item is very well made.

The only thing I wish I had known about it was that it is made of a plastic, but that is why I bought it.

I have not used it for a long time, but it does a good job.

The audio is good. The programming through the front panel (keypad) is easier than a Uv-5R. It has better audio than a Baofeng. It has better output than a Baoefeng (~1w more). The feel of the radio is great for the price range. the cross band repeat is a nice feature. The display is good, easy to read.

Now the bad...

-Chrip, not there yet. It actually corrupts several of the channel settings when I push this to the radio. This may change in the future, but with the latest (as of Dec. 1 2014) daily release...not there yet.
- The Wouxen software, not good. Its better than the Baofeng software, but I still find it challenging to move memory slots around.

Also, I want to include in memory several law enforcement frequencies, WX and PUD frequencies, but there is no way that I can see to disable TX? Whats up with that? On other radios, I can add frequencies to my channel memories, but I can disable TX for those. On the KG-U8D I see no way to do this. So I only hope that my kids don't get a hold of the radio and key down on those channels. I can disable TX on any other radio I own including the cheap UV-5R's; So I was really disappointed to see this.

Other than that, I find the Intermod on the radio not bad compared to other Chinese radios. Its not a yaseu but at a 1/3 of the price its not bad."

Kaitlin slowly falls for the one person her and her family have known to despise, however, as the reader starts to grasp the power of love in this novel...it gives judgment a whole new meaning.

Mary E. Pearson knows what she's doing. I love the surprise, twist'n turns and the balance of drama, romance, and mystery in this novel. I'd recommend this to any young adult who are looking for that classic love story that we all love with a guarantee of a soft, exciting, original teen love romance.

I would recommend this light to anyone who needs a light that works well.Great buy.  So much brighter than the other ones I have purchased.  No more having to buy these for the garage, kitchen, or bath.  The adjustable dimmer is a must.  I have tried several different dimmers in various sizes and colors.  I have also tried dimmers with different colors.  These work great.  I highly recommend them.  I bought 2 of these to replace the one in my son's bedroom.

Pet_Supplies_5,0,Buyer beware! This is not safe for KITTENS! My two month old kitten got her head stuck between the arch and the post. I manually pulled the post away to free her. She gagged three times immediately afterwards but seems fine now. If I hadn't have been there she could have perished! The space between the arch and post is too big for a baby kitty.
Pet_Supplies_5,0,This is my back up filter in case of power outage. It is simple to hook-up simple to clean and yes very quiet and easy to operate. Just set it up hang on the side and your done. I guess if you have a small tank it will work fine. Remember always buy more than your minimal rating or you will be sorry. I hook this up to a battery inverter in the event of a power failure to at least keep my 100 gallon tank with some sort of filtration. This was an issue with Hurricane Irma. All my fish and corals survived and doing great.

""  The headphone's design has rings that you can remove and shave down so the pads fit. 1/4 inch of ring will hold these pads perfectly. Exercise caution when stretching the pads over the rings.

Super high quality too, and the bright red color makes it impossible to lose in the hay bales!"

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"I really enjoy these cups.  Having 18/8 stainless (18% chromium and 8% nickel) means that these cups are food grade and will resist any corrosion.  That being said, I have used these cups around the house and have also taken them rock climbing; here is my summary:

Pros:
-Durable: I dropped these cups on rocks and they don't dent and will barely scuff.  Because they aren't colored, if they do scuff you barely notice.
-18/8: I do not foresee these cups corroding in any way. Additionally, they do not impart much flavor to the drinks.
-Environmentally friendly: no need for plastic.
-Solid: these cups are built well and are not flimsy at all.  This means they set well on rocks and on counters.  I don't worry about spilling my drinks.
-Clean look: The cup itself has a nice simple look to it. The logo looks nice and is not obnoxious in any way.
-Stackable: Bringing 5 cups on a camping trip does not take much space.

Cons:
-Metal: Although this might sound silly, because they are steel, the heat (or chill) from the drink distributes evenly to the cup and eventually to your hand.  Thus, these are not ideal for hot drinks
-Expandability: I would really like to see options to expand the use of these cups to hot fluids.  A silicone lid and a sleeve would make this insulated, keeping hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.  However, a can coozie (can cooler) works well to keep your hands from getting too hot or too cold.

Overall, I find them especially useful for camping because you can throw them into any backpack or tote and not worry about them breaking.  Additionally, they hold a lot of liquid and are easy to clean.  Even if you don't clean them, the flavors do not become part of the cup and bacteria do not grow well on stainless steel in general.

If you are looking for a stainless steel cup, I would highly recommend these."
Movies_and_TV_5,1,Four great comedies for one viewing. The only problem is that it's only for the first hour
Movies_and_TV_5,0,"Most T.V. viewers already know the Bob Newhart show from the number of times it's been syndicated. If you haven't seen it recently, now is the time to give it another look and see comedy which was driven by good writing rather than by overused and/or hackneyed sitcom plots. It's also a pleasure to see humor which isn't nasty or negative. The Bob Newhart show is downright ""fresh"" when viewed alongside current comedy fare.

As for the complaints about the packaging and lack of extras, one has to consider the *extremely* low price for the season and the experience Fox had with the Mary Tyler Moore show (another classic of the same era). Fox gave the first season of the Mary Tyler Moore show the star treatment and a higher price to cover the cost and it sold poorly. This made them reluctant to even release other classic comedies and the Bob Newhart show may never have seen a DVD release.

While I would have liked to have seen an interview with Bob offering some memories of  his experience with the show (or introductions), I think this type of comedy doesn't benefit much from commentary since the humor is in the pacing and the dialog. Talking over the show would seem rather disruptive and pointless. Also, I'm not sure how much anyone could remember from a show that aired so long ago.

As for the packaging, I like the slim cases and wish all DVDs were released in them. The thicker cases just take up more space on your shelves. Besides, it's what is on the discs that really matters and this show's humor has aged very gracefully. It's a delight to watch again."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"These black Signature by Levi Strauss & Co jeans are good for wearing under long sweaters or tops that hit mid thigh. They are not as heavy as normal jeans but they are thicker than jeggings and leggings, and fit like skinny jeans. There is quite a bit of stretch though so over time the rear end gets a little saggy. But overall, they are nice for the price and will hold up well if you don't plan to wear them every day."

If you have been following the other reviews, the video quality is poor and the sound is not as good as other earbuds.  It does not have a multi-function remote and is unable to provide full volume and a full range of sound.  I have had to use a second set of earbuds for my audio equipment to get it to work properly.  I have a pair of Sony earbuds that I would recommend for the price.  I would definitely recommend this item.

I highly recommend this product.I like that it has a feature where you can purchase a single USB drive for the price of the extender. It does work though, but only if you have a USB drive. Also, the extender is very small, so it will not fit in the small backpack on a trip. I recommend that you buy a USB extender.My daughter loves this mouse. She loves it.

Kindle_Store_5,0,"Caroline Andrews and Josh Summers were the match that I was looking for in this series. They had different reasons for needing a second shot. Love was not the only reason to need a second chance at something important. Their encountered began with the previous books of the series. Through their secondary interactions with the other leads made for a pleasurable journey for the two of them to finally make that step to creating a relationship in Forever, OR. Josh had experienced loss, confusion, and the desire to want what was once his. He knew this look when he saw it on the face of Caroline. There was this draw to Caroline that he could not deny. Finally getting that chance to make things more was the opportunity that he was looking for. Josh captivated me back a few book and the sweetness continues on. The sense of humor was on point and charming. He was all the dream qualities one wants in a man strong, sweet, patient, kind, and protective. His knack for baking pies makes him well liked. It also provides a connection for him and Caroline. I found Josh to my favorite Second Shot hero. He has my heart. Caroline was truly a match for him. Thank you Sara. Where are we heading next?

Electronics_5,0,"Nice magnifier for the price.  I looked at 3 brands when shopping.  Eotech , Vortex and Sightmark.  The Eotech is great but it is way out of my price range.  The sightmarks action to move it out of the way felt cheap and was not very fluid.  The Vortex went on sale for 159 which was a bargain.  The VMX-3T flips out of the way with a simple button movement.  Can easily be done on the fly one handed.  I like the way it feels.  The magnifier is very clear and works great when paired with a Eotech 512.  It comes with a hight spacer so that you can raise it a smidge if it is to low.  You can fully adjust where it is pointed through the side and top adjustments (like any scope).

The one down side which I find on all scopes if your eye is not at the right distance it shrinks the field of view.  I did not find this to bad in shooting with it though.

I have not used there warranty service but it covers everything except theft and intentional damage for the lifetime of the product.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"I bought two of these rash guards to take on a trip to Playa Del Carmen, Mexico. I bought one in XL and the other in XXL. The XL fit perfectly, but not like a baggy XL t-shirt would. It fits me more like a Large t-shirt would. But that's they way it's supposed to be. I'm a little out of shape these days so I wanted to get the next size up so I'd have two for two different activities. The XL I used for snorkeling and scuba diving because I didn't want the shirt to be to loose while doing those activities. The XXL, which fit more like an XL t-shirt, I used for hanging around the pool and going to the beach in.

I used both shirts every day that I was in Mexico and they were awesome. They fit well, dried fast, and kept me from getting burned. My skin was just as white returning home as when I left for Mexico, so they did their job. =) Of course, that wasn't the only reason I bought them. I'm not in the shape I used to be, so I spared the people at the resort from seeing my big white belly. =P

These shirts are fantastic...I highly recommend.

It is bright enough to see in a dark room, but not so bright that it causes vision problems. It is very easy to adjust the brightness of the light.

Kindle_Store_5,0,"Whew, this book may be one of the most intense love stories that I have ever read. I enjoy books about the corporate world, especially relationships involving an executive and a lower level employee. In Tracy Wolff's Addicted, CEO Ethan Frost and intern Chloe Girard are madly in love.  Actually, the word madly is an understatement, their love is completely all-consuming, and as a result they are unable to function when they are apart from each other.

After reading the dramatic prologue, I was hooked, at least for a little while. Some of the scenes are repetitive....Chloe running away almost every time she and Ethan have a problem, Ethan waiting for Chloe to come back to him, and Chloe's inability to cope with her past, to name a few. The story is good, what there is of it. A little less sex and a little more plot would have made the book more interesting.

Ethan is a likable character, albeit a bit tortured by his lack of pure common sense. He may be uber smart when it comes to business mergers, but when love is involved, he is downright simple. He does not learn from his mistakes because he makes the same poor choices over and over again. Chloe is an intelligent young woman, however, she is quite immature when it comes to being in a relationship. Chloe's best friend is a real hoot and I would have liked to learn more about her character.

Scorching sex scenes are an integral part of this book and Ms. Wolff does an excellent job of creating passion. Overall, a good read."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"My wife and I have an historic condo in a circa 1890's building - a truly lovely period place with high ceilings, wide moldings, huge pocket doors, marble fireplaces, wood floors, etc.  it cries out for period-piece furniture and ""atmosphere"" consistent with it's heritage.  We both love candles, but they have their drawbacks, from real flames in an older buidling (not a good combination) to dripping, wick-cleaning, etc.  Nevertheless, they are worth the effort.  When saw these I had to have them.  First, they look EXACTLY like real wax candles - and even kind of feel ""waxy"" (although they are not made of wax). And the electric ""candle"" light is authentic - and can be adjusted from just ""on"" to a ""flickering"" real candle effect.  And, best of all, you get a small remote control that you can use to turn them on, turn them off, and set an automatic timer to keep them on for 4 hours, 8 hours, or 24 hours, after which they will turn off.  They run on inexpensive batteries, which last forever, and put out zero heat - no fire hazard.  And, the look and light and flicking is incredible.  The only thing you don't get is a scent - but then again there are other ways to get that besides candles.  We love them, and the price is great.  Highly recommend."

Kindle_Store_5,1,"The second book was better, more predictable. It was a bit more of a thriller than the first. There was a lot of sexual tension and then the beginning of the story was boring. I guess it's just that the author didn't write them as well as the first two. I think it's because of the lack of emotional depth and the ending that I felt the ending was a bit rushed. This book felt like a waste of time. I don't feel like I'm going to read the next one because the series is too short.I'm not a big fan of a hero or heroine and this book definitely didn't disappoint. The characters were great and the story flowed well. I enjoyed this book and I will definitely be reading more of the series.

Pros
+ Small. As in this sucker will float to the bottom of your bag and you'll forget its there small!
+ It works! You pump air in and your tires get filled with air. What more do you want?
+ gauge seems pretty accurate to me.
+ Cheap!

Cons
- The plastic clip that holds the house to the body of the pump broke the second time I used it.
- How exactly is this a floor pump? Really, there is no way to hold it to the floor while pumping.
- Can require a fair bit of effort while pumping at higher PSIs."

The material is soft and a good quality.  The material is very light and breathable so I would buy again.  The color is just a little darker than the picture but still good.  The material is thin and stiff which makes it a little difficult to wear.  I would recommend ordering it again.  I will keep it for my sister's wedding dress and hopefully she will wear it as well.

It sticks to the concrete and holds it together keeping it from spreading out.  One of the really important functions is to seal the crack so that water can not get down to undermine the concrete or to fill the crack in the winter, freeze and spread the concrete apart.  It totally seals the crack.  Some cracks I have gone back the next year and applied a little more of the sealer to update the sealing of the crack.

I used toggle bolts to mount the bracket to the wall (3/16 x 3"") - I did need to open the holes in the bracket with a 3/16 drill bit - I always use toggle bolts when hanging something on a sheet rock wall and want to make sure the anchors don't loosen up or pull through.  As far as the downward angle - the downward tilt is about 45 degrees maximum - of you are looking for a fan that will tilt down further (like parallel to the floor), this is not the one. Otherwise this is an excellent buy.  The pull string on/off mechanism works very well - changes speed easily - no yanking. The 18"" diameter gives great air movement (not sure how many CFPM).

The story starts off simple, a murder, and evolves into something that effects the fate of the world.  A good portion of the story takes place in flashbacks, and shows how much effort and thought went into this story and how everything is connected together.  Another thing about this story is that it doesnt give away anything early, like in most comics, we find out when the charectors do.

Fortunately, i was able to apprehend her before she could take off with the bag of Kittles in her mouth.  I see quite a few other reviewers reported similar behavior.  Its amazing!  Do your cats a favor and get them this grain-free, gluten-free treat which is all natural, 2 calories per treat and over 150 treats per 2 oz bag. The #1 ingredient is real whitefish. No meat by-products."
Books_5,0,"Very good book.  Took me awhile, started in for the second time and never put it down...unbelievably realistic, this could actually happen. Didn't' see it coming, never would have it would end they it did. This is one you really need to read."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"Our oldest cat of 10 years has been having some GI tract issues that were occasionally causing him to have bloody stool. Sprinkling this stuff on his food has really made a difference and has greatly reduced the frequency in which that happens. None of our cats bat an eye before chowing down when they see it sprinkled over their food, so it must taste pretty good to them.

With this latest box that we ordered we noticed that nearly half of the packs were not properly filled and contained much less Fortiflora than they should have, but within 2 hours of bringing it to the seller's attention they agreed to send us a replacement box from a different batch so I didn't let that affect my rating of the product since it has worked so well for us.

EDIT: Just to avoid confusion, yes we are using the ""Canine"" Fortiflora for our cats. When we got our first box from our veterinarian they gave us the canine version and assured us that it was perfectly fine to use it for felines as well."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"my kitten straight up refused to eat this. i offered it to him several times on different days and occasions. the most he did was bat it around a couple of times.

to put it into context, he is NOT a picky eater AT ALL--- i feed him several types/brands of cat food- both wet and dry, and he EATS IT ALL-- i've yet to come across something he doesn't eat. i don't know what ingredient in this thing turns him off so much, but i feel like i wasted good money buying him something he hates."
Pet_Supplies_5,1,My dog loves this toy.  She is an aggressive chewer and will play with this toy every time she gets close enough to get a treat.  She is a chewer and it is worth the price.

Kindle_Store_5,1,"Okay, the story is good. But it's just too short. The story starts out with a self-help book about making your own meals and the recipes, so you don't have to go into it. But the next book will be about making your own food. I received a free copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review. This is a good book for a quick read. I love the characters and the story line. The characters are very well developed and the plot is well developed. This is a well written book. You will not be disappointed. I really enjoyed this book."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"I have to agree with the above posters. When I saw the price for these I cringed but my hearing is more important than 50 bucks so I ordered these and slapped them on. Yes, they are really great, no more gaps that let in unwanted sound when I turn my head. Only thing that makes me a tad upset is why the heck didn't these come with these sealing rings on them already.

My brother bought a pair of Howard Leight R-01526 Impact Sport Electronic Earmuffs and I tried them on and the earcups have a lot of gaps that let in sound and don't even have the option to upgrade the cups 8(, Pretty sad when those earmuffs cost $50.

I own a pair of 3M Peltor Tactical Sport Hearing Protector, MP3 Compatible $97,99 which I purchased here on Amazon. I bought these gelpacks for them and now I'm satisfied with the protection. Sad the manufacturer's for most of these headsets use inadequate cups out of the box. Anyways, these gelpacks will provide a much better seal and help save your hearing. Be well, be safe."

If a zany plot and quirky characters (to say nothing of an appealing dog who steals cling film wrapped human fingers from the 'fridge - don't ask, read for yourself) are your sort of thing, then you should definitely buy this.

Electronics_5,0,"I can cautiously recommend trying this router provided you can return it if you have problems. I have the dreaded (by some) A1 hardware revision, but without the problems others mention. This was the cheapest N router around at the time.

 The router set-up is easy if you are familiar with routers. However, do not rely on the wizard provided and be prepared to set it up manually. I will not fault D-link to much for that, as in my experience automatic router setup programs from Linksys and Netgear did not work any better either.

Make sure you upgrade firmware immediately to the latest available. It now remains to be seen how long this router will stay working. So far, I have no reason to regret buying it."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"I gave this Peet dryer 5 stars because it performs in exactly the way I expected it to when I purchased it.  We have basketball shoes that need to be dried each night after practice and tennis shoes that have been out in the snow and gotten soaked.  The Peet Dryer has a button so I can choose heat or no heat.  It also has a dial that allows me to choose how long it will run.  The timer goes up to 240 minutes.
The first time I used the dryer, I couldn't really tell if it was working.  I could hardly feel any air moving out of the shoe extenders.  I was wondering if it would work... it did.  It's easy to use and fairly quiet, so I can keep it plugged in and doing it's drying job in the entry way of our home and not be aware that it's running.  The unit is pretty lightweight, but not cheaply made.  The vertical extenders that I put the shoes on are thick plastic and removable.  The center fan/digital unit is attached to the base.  I can move it from place to place easily.
I use this item everyday.  It works well to dry the inside of wet or sweaty shoes.  I would recommend the dryer to anyone who wanted to preserve and protect their shoe investment.
I have no ""cons"" to share.  It's a simple concept that works well for athletic shoes and it's priced reasonably."

This is not a problem if you're going to use a car, so if you want to get the blades to fit, you will. This is a small knife, and a great addition to any tool box.

Pet_Supplies_5,1,This is a great activity for me and the dogs. I will keep this for the next couple of months. Great price and I will definitely order again!I bought this for my puppy's tank. It is a good size for her size. I use it for her water bowl and a 2 gallon aquarium. I also use it for the heater.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"I picked the ""Small"" size. For the review I chose ""Fits as expected"" but that's not EXACTLY true. The sleeves seem a bit too short for my liking, the body a bit too long for my liking. Perhaps that evens things out! But the overall size is nice, not too baggy and not too tight. Maybe a bit baggier than I'd like - it looks just like the picture - I could go for something a tad more form fitting.

The sleeves are a bit short for my liking; raising my hands up pointing ahead of me results in about 3 inches of arm are exposed.

The body length is a bit too long for my liking by about 2-3 inches. I was worried this would be very form fitting and thus wouldn't allow for a heavier shirt underneath. But the the small fits me about the way shown in the product picture. There's room for a sweater/sweatshirt.

The areas with fleece are warm, soft and comfortable. The sleeves do not have a fleece lining but they too are very comfortable - after all, arms move a lot so having a thinner material makes for easier movement. Nice.

I would not mind if it was a BIT more form fitting, it's ever so slightly frumpy (again as seen in the product photo).

Aside from the sizing.. it's still very comfortable. Has ties to make it a bit smaller, a nice little hood that doesn't fall over my eyes, the fleece is super soft and comfortable and made me noticeable warmer in a cool room. Has on inside pocket on your left side. Very solid product especially for the price."

So it was to that kind of place to which this book took me back, certainly as the character Cherie describes her desire to order up the perfect man, and then goes on a funny and insightful journey of eroticism, rejection, conflict, confusion and pulling it all together again. This book was a very enjoyable elixir."

I did not want to have to replace it since the TV was so cheap. It works fine and seems to last for quite a while. It's very easy to use and holds the TV in place without having to pull it out of the case. I just put a piece of cardboard and tape it on top of the TV. I put the TV in a stand, and I put it in the back of my car. It's easy to put on and it's nice. I wish it had the built in bluetooth as well as a power button.

It is more comfortable than I thought it would be. I don't have to worry about the buckle getting stuck. I like that it does not get stuck while I'm walking. I like that it does not have a strap that can be removed. The other pants I have have had trouble with it getting stuck. I have had problems with it getting stuck in the bag while I was walking. I can't say much about that because I haven't had any problems with it getting stuck. I would recommend it for those that have problems. I had this one on my bike for about 2 months.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"I redeemed points on Amazon and treated myself to this Frye bucket bag when it was massively reduced earlier in the Spring. The leather is super supple and the crossbody is a cinch to adjust (get my little joke there??). The bag has only one main compartment, but has the standard two slip pockets and a zippered pocket on the opposite side. Very nice neutral bone/off white color, however the leather gets EASILY dirty and of course the dye from my jeans rubbed off on the bottom of the bag (ironic, since it was the lining that I didn't care too much for!!). I'll have to really baby this bag and clean it each and every time I use it (even with wearing lighter colored clothing). I have to admit, the bag is HEAVY - the hardware and tag are made of thick metal, so be careful if you're the type who carries everything and the kitchen sink!!  Even with plenty of room for more of my junk, I still heard it clinking around when I slung it on my shoulder. Still, a very functional and neutral handbag."

We don't have matching spice canisters, but the majority of our spices are from Walmart & Aldi...and they fit just fine as they are.  It comes with 2 sets of screws.  One bag contains screws with plastic anchors for drywall installation, the other set comes with short, thick screws for wood installation.  First 2 screws went in with ease, but the third screw busted only 3/4 of the way in..the head broke right off!  I know I didn't ""over-tighten"" because the screw wasn't even in all the way!

The movie is in English, which is one of the most important languages in the world. It is a great way to introduce yourself to the story, and it is a great way to get a sense of the characters and their motivations. The special effects are excellent, and the cinematography is superb.

The sound is excellent. I liked the song ""Yes, That's Me"" and the movie's theme. The movie does have a good story, but it is a shame it is not as good as the original. It is an excellent movie for the kids and adults alike.The movie has a good story, but it is not as good as the original.

Started watching this on my Blue-Ray but found I could not reverse or speed forward. It just stops the movie. I notice that many commented how difficult it was to read the white-letter captions when foreign [ non-English ] words were being spoken but I did not find this to be a problem at all. It would have been nice to have closed captions for the English as well because of the pronunciation of the Spanish words.

The main problem I had was the issue of having to watch the entire movie without being able to reverse or speed forward.

I  will try it on my DVD player [ when I have access to it ] to see if the functions work better on a different device. This is the only reason it did not get five [5] stars. Otherwise.....

Way to go Amazing-zon!!!

This is Susanne O`learys latest book which I've had the greatest of pleasure in reading as an ARC.
Isn't the cover great!
I love this author as she's taken a different chance on this story, more intense and romantically raw in my opinion with things to hide that come out later as you read further on into the pages.

I liked this one as much as I loved her previous book Hot Property. This isn't a carry on from that, its a stand alone book in its own right.
Its taken me today to sit down and read this lovely enjoyable read.
Susanne never disappoints her readers, yet another thumbs up from me."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"This is definitely the cutest apron I've ever owned! It also seems to be treated with some kind of scotchguard or startch, as the material is very stiff (but also water resistant). I splashed some water on myself while I was doing dishes and it did not soak through to my clothes underneath! It is easily machine washable, though may require another treatment after a few washes to keep the stiffness and water resistance.

It falls just about at my knees, a perfect length in my opinion. The pockets are well crafted, but could be a little bigger.

The only gripe I have is that the cute low-cut V neck style leaves a lot of empty space to be filled by splashes and drips. I can see myself managing to get that area dirty since there is nothing covering my clothes."

It's easy to find cheap sheets or good sheets, but getting to the perfect middle is difficult sometimes.

It's still too hot to use the cover with a duvet, but it serves as a nice top sheet for now."

When I found out Time Life released the whole series on DVD I couldn't wait to buy them.  Getting the first season I watched every episode and I loved them.  It was like going back into my childhood, and I found this show is timeless.  You can be a kid and love it and you can be an adult and still laugh at Maxwell Smart's crazy antics.

He is the quintessential rocker who shows a tender side when it comes to his ""Peach"".

They are just not the most durable or nice looking. The color is very pale pink and not very vibrant.

Pet_Supplies_5,0,"I own 4 Mini Schnauzers.  This doggy door has been a dream.  We installed it on the ground level of our basement door.  I am no longer a door man for my dogs.  Yah!  My dogs learned to be completely potty trained by 4 months of age, since they could go outside when they needed to go.  The 2 flaps close fairly reliably to keep out the bitter cold.  This ends up to be quite an energy saver since only a little air gets in the house.  Compare that to the amount of air that comes in the house when you have to open a door for a dog to go outside.

Here is the drawback.  My dogs love to grab shoes and anything else they can find and drag it out to the back yard.  I have to go out regularly to pick up the things they drag out there.  I also have to close the door occasionally since they can start to dig holes in the yard if given too much outdoor freedom.  I also close the door occasionally so the dogs won't bark at neighbors.  That is OK with me.  Overall this doggy door gives me and the dogs so much more freedom to do our thing!  Yes I do love it!"

I am not sure if I like a good mystery or if I want to read another one. I am a big fan of the historical fiction genre and this book is a good read. I like that the story is not too long.

Toys_and_Games_5,0,"Fits perfectly into any existing train set but is even better as a starter set.

Strangely the green engine that comes with this set is the only train that has a problem passing under the bridge. This is out of 15 different train cars by different makers. On a perfectly flat surface its not an issue but on carpet the green engine must be push/pulled through the overpass.

My other issue is the engines don't have magnets on the front. The Thomas and Chuggington engines all have magnets on the front and back. So there are times they get ignored in favor of other trains that don't have to take the lead. However the trailing cars do have magnets on both sides.

But even taking all that into consideration this is a great buy and I'd definitely suggest it as a beginning point for any child interested in trains."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,These are great and work with the Neato D80. I contemplated getting a generic brand but after thinking it through and ordering and comparing the Neato replacement filter with this brand I decided to go with the brand. I found that the material used to make the pleats of the filter were of higher quality than the original filter however a note to this is that filters on these units will get irreversibly clogged up with dirt and you will be better off replacing the filter after about 20-30 cleanings depending on the composition of dirt on the floors. That said the filters are consumable items and being able to purchase these filters at a lower (approx. 1/2) price meant that I could have more of them. The extra side brushes are also a needed item because like a little pet there is no telling where the side brush may come off the unit.
Pet_Supplies_5,0,Like these Hamilton Collars and the way they stand up to my very active dog.  My Viszla is just under 50 lbs but he thinks he is bigger.  He has always been a puller and these collars seem to withstand that. They don't fray.

Kindle_Store_5,0,"Awesome, sexy, sassy, but most of all just heart warming."
Books_5,0,"This was my first time reading this classic and I really didn't know what to expect. I had seen the movie version several times and in my opinion I really enjoyed the book so much more (Although the movie earns it's own merit's). It left me speechless and it really made me think about what Scarlett O'Hara had been through and it really made me for feel her and the other characters in the story. I was really impressed with the story Margaret Mitchell created. I can see why this got the Pulitzer Prize in 1937. If this has to be the book you choose for your next read, make it this one for sure!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"I've been waiting for these boots all my life.  I have had severe lower back problems for a couple of decades.  I can do pretty much everything, including walking, without too much discomfort, but standing for any period more than a couple of minutes is incredibly painful.  Last weekend I spent 6 hours on my feet in these boots while canning and I never got sore at all.  Without sounding hyperbolic, these boots are kind of life-changing for me.  No other ""comfort"" shoe or boot has ever made one bit of difference in how I can function; these boots allow me to do everything I never wanted to do before: shop; socialize on my feet; work, etc.
As for the fit, I sized down as I have with my other FitFlops and there's still a little bit of extra room.  I don't mind this because I live in a place where thick socks make sense.  They fit well with a pair of thick socks, or two pairs of regular weight socks.
As for how they look, when I first put them on I thought they looked a bit like moon boots or Earth Shoes.  I was ambivalent about wearing them for the first couple of days and just kept trying them on in front of the mirror until I got used to them.  Now I LOVE the way they look and have gotten many compliments on how cute and stylish they are.  The look is a bit of a departure for me, as I'm used to wearing a bigger, more masculine boot, like a biker boot or a Doc Marten.  But these are adorable.  I love the extra height they give me.  I love that I can tuck my pants in or wear them over.  I've pretty much worn them every day for the last couple of weeks.  I'm already looking at getting a suede pair.
Buy these boots.  They're everything."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"I've never used a chain link scrubber before, but I'm so pleased with how well this cleaned my cast-iron stove-top grill. The links are firm and good quality and it took off grime that a scrub brush couldn't touch.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,I ordered two sets = $24. 00 each. I will keep them for the next couple months. Great price!Works great. The ring is a nice white color and the color is a little darker than the picture. I wish it was a bit thicker. I love it. I love the color and the size. It is a little heavier than I expected. I would not buy again. Great. I like that the very first time I used it I felt it was going to break. I'm not sure how long it will hold up but it's a good size. It fits perfectly in my glass cabinet. I'll be ordering more. I'm using it for my daughter's room. Very nice for the price. Love it!Easy to clean.

The material is not durable, so it will be hard for most people to find a good one. The bottom line is, it's a great starter kit and I think it will last a long time. I have a few other kit on my bike and a few other bikes that have been very good, but this is by far the best I have found. I have a spare tire, and a spare tire that fits on my bike.

The mouse is small enough to fit in a pocket but the feel of the mouse is so nice it's like wearing a swimsuit in a pool.  This one is still very good for the money.  I'm also using it with a Logitech YogaPad with a 3.5"" touchpad.  The touchpad is pretty good.  I like that the touchpad is not too close to the screen.  The keyboard is really nice and easy to use.  The color is pretty good and the keyboard is really easy to use.  The only thing I wish it was better is that it's a bit bigger.  It's a bit too small for my thumb and it's a little too big for my hand.  I'm happy with the keyboard.  I don't really mind the size of the keyboard though.  I like the size of the keys.  The small size makes it easier to use on my desk.  I don't mind that it's a little bigger than my iPad.

The keyboard is very nice and I like that the keyboard has a magnetic keypad which is nice.  It's a nice touchpad.  I like the small size of the keys and the solid feel of the keys.

You can see how the bacon is cooking and either shorten the cooking time or lengthen it to have bacon just the way you like it or need it. Sometimes we need partially cooked bacon to use in recipes where it needs to be flexible for incorporation with other food, and then cooked to completion. This product perfectly satisfies that need. I highly recommend this product for anyone who uses/enjoys perfect bacon."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"I have tried a few other lamps. The non-diode are too hot, and the multi-diodes kept flickering and going out one-by-one, so I went simple and liked the looks of this one. You have to attach the lamp to the base, but the instructions are good and it only takes 5 minutes. I have big hands, so the two Philip head screws underneath were a bit fiddly. The base is iron and heavy, with a plastic surround and a felt-like pad underneath.

The light is focused and quite aim-able. The neck holds its place well. From one foot (30 cm) up, the lens spreads the main light to a circle with a diameter of about 1 feet, which is what I desired.

I it simple, elegant, and does exactly what I want. Other reviewers say the switch goes bad after a while and causes the light to flicker, but apparently it can be replaced rather easily if that happens (I hope IKEA reads those reviews and works on a better switch, as it seems to be the only down side - for some - for this very nice product)."

It's a very interesting story. This book is a great read for anyone who is looking for a quick and easy read. I hope it goes on to be more of a book for the ages. I was not disappointed.

As to the loose handle, a pair of #47 O-rings (AS-568 #009), easily available at any hardware or home improvement store, will give you the ability to remove the handle as needed, or use it in any position along it's length without falling out - a feature I like."
Movies_and_TV_5,0,"I got this originally because I was into the Lorelei's Grasp based on reviews I read. I'd never seen a Naschy go this way or that way, and ended up watching Horror rises from the Tomb first and really dug it. If you're still harboring prejudice against Spanish horror films from the 70s based on the old bad dubbed VHS cropped dupe days, well, arise and be free. The film looks great and is full of wondrous stuff for Eurosleaze fans - a great mix of Gothic trappings, lurid horror and Naschy writing in scenes where he gets to paw his actresses' naked breasts every five minutes. Oh Paul, what are we going to do with you?

Ironically I like it better thah Lorelei, the reason I bought the set! It can be frustrating: a slimy rubber glove claw hand is offing nubile babes at a boarding school, one by one, and all the local polizei (it's German) can do is treat the girls like idiots and send them back to their rooms, then shake their heads in disbelief when they're murdered two minutes later... ""we did all we could"". Some people like movies where cops are staking out a school being attacked nightly by a monster, and then one of the girls complains there's breathing in her room and the cops just think she's imagining it and then act surprised an hour later when she's dead -- oh those hysterical women! At least that's how I remember it. You get the idea though. Eventually there's a twisted dark reflection of THE LITTLE MERMAID's trans-species / terrain love affair and a cool underwater cavern lair."

Kindle_Store_5,0,"I really enjoy novels involving angels and demons so this was a given for me, especially considering it was published by Random House Flirt, which is quickly becoming one of my favorite publishing imprints. This novels plot kept me thoroughly engaged with its battle between good and evil. Sophia St. James moves to a small town in Connecticut, never expecting to see Guardian Angels in spirit form. In fact, she is the only one who can.
Sophia was a great character. She was strong and brave and I loved her narration. Michael was the angel. He was moody, protective, and volatile. It was really hard to figure out what he was feeling, but I loved his character nonetheless. He had good intentions. Dante was the Demon Knight who was convinced that the reincarnated soul of his lost lover was in Sophia. He was one of those evil characters you couldn't help but somewhat enjoy because of their passion for whatever they are doing. Regardless, I am definitely Team Michael. This novel had the typical love triangle (good boy, bad boy, and the girl stuck between) but it had a unique spin on it that prevented it from becoming a trope.
Forbidden was a thrilling and thoroughly entertaining novel about an angel, and demon, and the girl who cant figure out who she wants. I cant wait to get my hands on the second book, Awaken, because I am sure that Lori Adams will continue to write a great story."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"PROS:
1. This allows you to get ""flatter"" against your work, so it's critical for certain tasks.
CONS:
1. Very cheaply constructed, and doesn't last long.  You'll need to replace these regularly.
2. Runs very hot and noisy.
3. Very difficult to install and remove from the main unit.  Not something you can just swap on and off easily.
TIPS:
1. Don't run it too fast, or for too long.  Let it cool off from time to time.
2. When installing and removing shafts (the rod with the disc at the end), insert a spare shaft through the hole near the tip of the angle attachment, to prevent the main shaft from turning while you tighten or loosen it.  If you use the button that's built-in to the main tool, you'll strip the gears in the right-angle attachment."

The material is very durable, and it will last for years.  I would highly recommend this product.I love these shorts!  I wear size 10 and they fit perfectly!  They are very comfortable and I can wear them as a pair.  I like that they are not too tight and have a little stretch on the back.  I love that they are made of a soft fabric and are very stretchy.  I do like that they are not too big to wear on the trail.  They are well made and I would recommend them to anyone.I like the color and quality. I have a little pinky finger in the pinky finger area. I like the fact that it has a little pinky side. I have a small pinky finger in the middle. This is a little tight at first, but after wearing it for about 5"

Pet_Supplies_5,0,We have a mini schnauzer and this works well on him. He barks and raises hell with everyone & thing in the alley. We have a privacy fence but he still challenges every body and ignores spoken commands. With the Pet Agree I can be on my deck some 40 plus feet away from the dog barking thru the fence and and give the unit just a quick tap and instantly redirect the dog's attention and stop his barking. I find he is barking at things real or imagined much less than before we got the Pet Agree. And if needed a quick tap always does the trick.

Movies_and_TV_5,0,"Never heard about this one, but ended up glued right through to its end. Great find! A dark comedy about a teenager's frustration with setting out on the road to self-discovery and coming to a dead end.

The dialogue is nimble, the music apt, and the screenplay a refreshing change from the pat assembly-line teenybop flicks cranked out several times a year by Hollywood. The plot is peripheral, it's the characters and a fluid narrative that take center-stage.

As delightfully droll but cynical 17 year-olds facing the first challenges of adulthood -- leaving home, getting a job, finding a love life -- the two female protagonists do a fabulous job of coming across as outsiders among their peers never quite trying to ""fit in"".

In what begins as a harmless goof, one of them finds herself drawn to schleppy forty-something Seymour (Buscemi), a regular Joe and collector of 78rpm records. You know Buscemi from character roles in a bunch of popular movies, including Reservoir Dogs; all pent-up cynicism and inherent geekiness, he couldn't be more perfect in this role.

Thrown in are other interesting caricatures of some pretty credible small town characters, notably an art teacher who got more inane with every highfalutin bit of art she expounded on high school kids.

Thankfully, the movie resists the temptation of convenient closures so some may take issue with how it all turns out for the teenage girl and the middle age geek. But it feels more real this way.

What a marvellously done film. Rent it pronto, even the credits are worth it."

On the way he meets Aislinn who is going going for the what if because until now nothing else has worked. Oh and she does not want to have anything else to do with doctors so Hugo best be wary. Added to the lovely mix is also Punda who is drawn to them so this author takes you with them to weave her special blend of magic to give you their story here. What will soon be discovered though for Aislinn will be hard to break but with the love she can receive from these two anything is possible. Hugo will also learn that there is more to life then mere science and that the best is yet to come. Righteous title that is fitting to say the least with the reader can find out why. Punda will also get more than she asked for or thought she would need but after you get to know her what she will get is perfect. Great battle with the winners taking the prize.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"I had compared the dimensions on the site to a fleece jacket I had and the Condor came up a little short (less than 1/2 inch though) in each dimension compared to the fleece dimensions.  I ordered the 3X (there is no 4X).  It is a nice jacket, I just do not like the way it drapes on the body.  The Spandex does not really allow it drape anyway.  I am 6 feet plus and about 260 pounds.  It does fit snugly but I think it is really the Spandex.  If I could relax the Spandex a bit, I would really like this jacket.  I love the number of pockets, especially the fore arm pocket.  I use it for my ID card.  I love the hood with the visor.  I wear it to work over a tee shirt and polo shirt normally.  I would say it would be comfortable no lower than the high 40s F by itself.  You could extend that if you wore a fleece or sweater underneath.  It is more comfortable in the 50s F though.  I have worn it in some pretty good wind and rain storms.  Wind intrusion is not a problem.  So far, the rain has not penetrated the material either.  The slash pockets are a little high up for me though.  It could be an inch or 2 longer in the overall length.  It could also be a bit more packable.  I wanted it to roll up in the bottom of my work back pack for when I travel.  Does not really lend itself to that though."

Movies_and_TV_5,0,"These two movies give Johnny Depp a great opportunity to show his acting range, and he doesn't disappoint.

""Sleepy Hollow"" is perhaps the definitive film version of this well-known tale, though it is not for the faint-of-heart. It gets pretty gory, what with the Headless Horseman out and about his business. We tend to watch this film around Halloween...then see if we can get over its ghastly images by Xmas.

I saw ""Sweeney Todd"" on Broadway with Len Cariou, Angela Lansbury and Victor Garber many years ago. Cariou and Lansbury were spectacular. Garber, not so much - Sondheim's music for the male ingenue role is pretty ungracious, and neither Garber nor Jamie Campbell Bower in this film version has any success negotiating the vocal writing.

Depp's film Sweeney is a great deal more-frightening and disturbed than what I saw on B'way. That's possible in large part because he doesn't have to project his singing voice and stage persona into a live theatrical space (truth is Depp's singing voice wouldn't project well into the open space of a typical B'way theater without major amplification). That makes for a more-intimate, more-human portrayal, and it's fairly disturbing. The rest of the cast is good as well.

Both films were directed by Tim Burton who seems to get the best out of Depp. The ""By The Sea"" sequence in Sweeney is particularly touching in fleshing out the human sides of Todd and Mrs Lovett that might have been in a way that just isn't possible in the staged version.

If you want to enjoy Sweeney as a disturbed horror flick, get this version. If your main interest is hearing the music, get the 1982 ""Tribute"" version with Lansbury and George Hearn.

Recommended (the price is certainly right - I paid only $10.86 with tax for both movies!), but not for the squeamish."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"I was puzzled to see why this only has four stars, since mine is beautiful and works great. I did have to unscrew it when I first got it because the battery had come loose and was rolling around in the lamp, but I simply stuck it back into place and the lamp works fine. The colors are vibrant and really pop both during the day and when it's lit up at night. And the light is actually a rather bright white, which is emitted from a small stalk of three tiny LED lights gathered into a bunch at the bottom, like grapes. The stake leaves a little something to be desired, though, since it was a little difficult to put together (I had to take the screw out of the pole and then re-insert it, since it was in crooked) and it's not the sturdiest while in the ground. The stake itself is fine enough, but the pole is so narrow that it can't really support the weight of the lantern, which causes the lamp to easily swivel around. But once it's in place, it's fine. I have it next to my walkway to add curb appeal to the front yard, and it looks really pretty both during the day and at night. I was debating getting a second one simply for better symmetry, but the one lantern as it is looks perfectly fine, even charming by itself."

Books_5,0,"Just to correct some other comments, the present book is only ""Jane Eyre."" It is not a collection of books by the Bronte sisters as implied in the spotlight comments above.

This is a great read. I bought this Oxford Classic after reading some very negative comments by Virginia Woolf in her polemic ""A Room of One's Own."" There she thought that Charlotte Bronte had gone overboard mixing fiction with her own conservative views of feminism. So, I was eager to see how bad this book was.

This is a great read and I read the book almost non-stop for two days. It is hard to put down. This was Charlotte Bronte's first successful book and it is her best. I am reading her next book written after ""Jane Eyre"", ""Shirley,"" and it is not as clearly structured. The present book is similar in some ways to that great classic ""Madame Bovary"" in that it is compact, concise, and consists of a well formulated plot; and, it has one strong central protagonist. It is a clear and compelling read. By the way, the character is almost the complete opposite of Madame Bovary in terms of morals.

One can quibble about parts of the story since it relies to some extent on coincidence and luck. Those parts lack realism.

The book was attacked by Christians at the time of publication almost 160 years ago and later by feminists. But that is secondary.

This Oxford version has a good analysis. It has a biography of Charlotte Bronte and comments on her sisters. The Oxford introduction by Sally Shuttleworth places the book in histrical context. Also, extra notes are included on the text. I read the comments after reading the book, and the less you know about the plot before reading the book better off you will be.

This is simply a great read."

Kindle_Store_5,1,"She knows what she is getting into, she has no idea how to turn her life around.

This book had me laughing, laughing and then crying. This book was definitely a great read. I look forward to reading more from this author.This was an excellent read. The characters were strong, likable, and the story line was great. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a fun, steamy read.I enjoyed this book. I love how the heroine is a strong heroine who is strong."
Books_5,0,Bedford's handbook is quite handy for a non-expert.  Anyone who's going to be teaching Shakespeare but hasn't written a dissertation on him ought to pick one up.

Pet_Supplies_5,0,"I bought a mixed breed from a breeder that looked 100% like a pure bred, so I got this and sure enough the test showed the 2 and only 2 breeds he's supposed to be. This is a great idea for people with an unknown mix. You need to know what diseases a dog may be prone to get. The vet will probably have a much more accurate result if you want to go that route, but the vets I asked said the test takes 4-6 months and I didn't want to wait. I got the results in 2.5 weeks after the lab received it. I didn't get an email confirmation that it was ready, but I checked every day anyway after 2 weeks. It was no easy task swabbing a puppy, so best of luck to you."
Kindle_Store_5,0,"This book was so great. Just a heads up though -- if you haven't read the other books (like me), you'll be a little lost. Not so much that you can't follow the story, but definitely enough to make you go, ""Uuuhhhhhh, who are these people?""

That being said, I do not regret buying this book. It was steamy and super amazing! I can't wait to read more books from Sapphire!"
Pet_Supplies_5,1,"When is XS not exactly what it says it is? I will say that it's been a couple months and it seems to be doing a good job of protecting the cover from the rain.The dog loves it.  I'm not sure it's going to work for him.  I think it's just a filler product.  I'd be more inclined to buy another one.We have a great mix of cats and dogs and these are perfect. They last a long time.We have a German Shepherd who is very hard on treats.  We put this on him every time he tries to eat it.  We have used it a couple of times.  It is a wonderful tool for dogs and it does a great job of keeping the treats fresh.  I would recommend it.I have a 35 pound pit bull mix and she was going crazy over this toy.  I gave it to her for the first time ever in a long time.  She has not destroyed it yet.  She is a senior pit bull mix and she loves this toy.  I would highly recommend this toy.Great, very strong, and I ordered it for my lab.  It's made from the same stuff as a lot of other brands and it's a little big for my 13 lb. lab.  It's perfect for her and I love that it's made from a high quality material.  I bought this because she loves the smell of this product and I'm very pleased with it.  I will definitely buy this again.I have a small puppy"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"This bag is great. I have all kinds of bike bags because none really worked that well for my needs. They were either, two small or inconvenient to use. This one has a tremendous amount of space without using the expansion. It is also shaped well so it doesn't interfere with pedaling. ie your thigh doesn't hit it. Not only do I have the normal tools but I have put my big ass kryptonite chain and lock in the bag, all without using the expansion and I still have room to put a wallet and keys in there! I never use exclamation points by the way. The mounting/compression straps and connectors work well. It seems durable as well. It is so great that I plan to buy two more for other bikes."

Note to self: don't rust what your sister says when you ask her if there is a 2 inch port on the size of a credit card on her laptop, check it out for yourself :D"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,Great driver. I have a small 9mm Glock 17 and this is by far my favorite.  The grip is adjustable and the front sight is also adjustable.  The cover is very sturdy and it keeps my gun from getting caught in a crossfire.  I use it for hiking and also for a 2 day outdoor bike ride.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"My review is not based on the converse shoe itself which we like but the service provided thru amazon. It is the 2nd time this has happened to me, I clearly got the women sizing but was sent mens sizing instead and they vary by 2 sizes!! So my daughter who is a 6.5 women should get a 4.5 mens size. But when choosing I clearly chose womens 6.5 so I don't know why the mix up."

I wish there was more to the story. I would like to see more of the author's work.This book was very interesting to read"

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"Came in the mail really fast! 2 days time. Very good quality made ring. The brushed tungsten is darker than what the product photo shows, but still an attractive ring. My fiance' bought this as my wedding ring since we are on a budget, but again, it's very quality material & I'm very content with this purchase 

My ring finger was fitted as a 14 at some Jewelry Stores. I even had the chance to handle all the ring size rings myself to check it out, to find that perfect fit. 14 seemed to do the job. This ring does fit a tad bigger than what I was fitted for, so I would suggest you go down .5 of a size to ensure perfect fit. It's summer time here in Ohio & our fingers swell up in warmer weather, so the ring is secure enough not to fall off for now. But as soon as fall & winter arrive, I know I will have to purchase a 13.5 in a couple months so I can wear a ring in colder weather. But that's okay however, since the ring only cost the low price of $24, it won't even be an issue!

I hope my review helps someone in their decision making? There were other reviews specifically talking about the size offness, & with my confirmation, they were correct. Just buy one a half size smaller to match true fit!

God bless you all & may peace be upon you! I humbly ask for your prayers as I'm entering into Holy Matrimony here in 3 more days for a peaceful marriage, life longevity & happiness 

P.S.

The reason I gave it only 4 Stars was due to the fact the brushed Tungsten is darker than the picture shows & the half size differ that I & many others are talking about"

Books_5,0,"I thought I liked the first 2 books of this series; then I read this one and fell in love!

I don't want to give away too much, or anything at all. The dialogue is getting better, Kate is getting funnier and Curran is going to have to become real so I can marry him.

All skills are tested in this book. We start to get more information about who Kate really is, and what makes her so powerful. The chemistry between Curran and Kate is getting unbearable, for them and me! But she's not some dimwitted woman who falls for just anyone because he's cute (a.k.a. Rachel Morgan).

Read this, fall in love and kick yourself if you forgot to take home the next book..."
Books_5,1,"This is truly a heartwarming story, with a sense of hope and hope for the future.  It's not the best book, but it is the most honest.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to know how to live a better life.I enjoyed the series.  I was looking forward to reading the next book in the series and having to wait for the next one to come"
Toys_and_Games_5,1,I got this for my son for Christmas. He loved it. He loves to play with it and plays with it often. He is 3 and loves to take it out of the car and put it in the trunk. He loves it and is still having fun with it. It is a great toy and I would recommend it to any child who is interested in learning about animals. My son loves it. We bought this for our grandson. He loves it. He uses it to play with his little brother. He's very happy with it.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,1,Really really nice for the price. The only problem is that it's a little too large for me
Kindle_Store_5,1,This is the story of a young girl with a history of being a killer. She is one of the few survivors. The story moves at a steady pace and the characters are strong and interesting.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Lighting can set the mood, whether you want a relaxing atmosphere or and exciting one, lighting can be used to create it. I received the Ohuhu Ocean Wave LED Light Projector and Speaker to review and it is wild!
This is more than an average light changing lamp. A small disc over the 12 LED lights moves while projecting the light through the 5 1/4 inch rippled lens, creating wonderful, ever-changing waves across the ceiling, wall or any surface it is aimed towards.
The patterns and colors are mesmerizing! The push of a button takes you to the next color. There are 8 different color patterns taking you from a multi pattern to red, to blue to green. Pick one that fits you mood.
This lighted orb also contains a speaker and an input to plug in your mp3 player, computer, your phone, etc so you can enjoy your music at the same time.
The projector can be operated off a wall outlet via the included outlet adapter or it can be operated off a USB device. You can take this almost anywhere to enjoy the hypnotic waves of color. It automatically turns off after an hour. I do wish there was a switch to deactivate the auto off for times when you want it to stay on longer. It's not that big of a deal to push the button to turn it back on though.
I love just turning off the light and having this cast waves over the ceiling and walls while watching TV or working on the computer. It gives me a tranquil feeling that calms me and lets my mind relax a little.
This lamp is great in the living room, bedroom or even a kid's room. You can experience the tranquil waves of color from the Ocean Waves Projector by scooting over to Amazon. Flood your room with color!"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"I thought the quality of this boot was lacking. They were stiff and felt cheap. Also, the lacing is really weird: two of the lacing holes on either side are not the usual metal rings you'd expect; the laces go through loops of leather. This makes it difficult to pull the laces tight or loosen them when you want to take the boots. off. I don't recommend."

It worked wonderfully with individual HDMI feeds plugged into it, has a great picture, bright clean, and the speakers even were loud enogh  for covering a small room well. Contacted Benq and Pioneer about the issues. Both said it was a fluke and Benq suggested an MH 630, which I have swapped to try. Hopefully will handle this."

Kindle_Store_5,0,"I read the short story version of this book right after I finished ""The Blood & Bone Trilogy. I don't remember if I left a review but I do know I gave it 3 ***'s. What I do remember was how robbed/cheated I felt because the short story should have been so much  more.

I can't really explain how exited & pleased I was at received an email from the Author saying she changed her mind about Suicide "", the original title and making it into a three part trilogy. Let's just leave it at there may have been some singing, The Happy, Happy, Joy
Joy song & the happy dance might've made a brief appearance.
This third of the new trilogy is excellent!! :)  The author took a mediocre, at best, short story & turns it into an incredible novel!!  She superbly snakes around the existing material and proficiently pours powerful scenes into the narrative that grab your attention and not let it go.  Also, I really like that she is keeping this trilogy in the same universe of "" The Blood & Bones Trabsolutely cake &It means we already have a basic working knowledge of the paranormal place & persons. There's no time wasted in big chunks of world &/or character  building.

I absolutely cannot wait for the next two booka."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"If your using Tidy Cat your not using the best.  We where faithful Tidy Cat purchasers for over 10 years then after taking up our carpets to go back to the hardwood underneath we where shocked by how much litter was in and under the carpet, yes we vacuum.
Within a week of having hardwood floors again we where shocked how much litter was all over the house, not to mention in the bed - ughh.  Also we found that Tidy Cat wasn't clumping as well as it use to and we were always fishing out tiny clumps too.
Well it was time to do something about the mess so we decided to try a different litter.  WOW if you have never used Cat's Pride Fresh and Light litter you have to try it!  Tidy Cat is like little balls, Cat's Pride is not.  Cat's Pride is a very light litter which is a big plus, no strong scent and clumps great!  We have 2 covered litter boxes side by side one still with Tidy and one with Cat's Pride. I put a 4' x 5' piece of astro truf (outdoor type) in front of the boxes and still have to sweep Tidy off the hardwood in that room, hallway and adjoining rooms but no Cat's Pride.

I hope you find this review helpful and think if you just give Cat's Pride Fresh and Light a try you will never buy any other brand again!"

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"I have kinda a love/hate relationship with these flashlights. I love that they are super affordable and you get three flashlights. They are plastic, not aluminum, but the tolerances seem tight and they appear relatively water resistant. I left the floodlight on last night and after 4-1/2 hours the light intensity was down to about 25%, but still usable.

The non-focusing flashlight produces a tight, bright beam that easily illuminates objects 50-75 feet away. The light bar floodlight works great for close up work or will light half a room bright enough to read. The rubberized flat black exterior is nice and ""grippy."" The magnet is sufficient to hold the light vertically or horizontally on smooth sheet metal.

Ugly? Oh, man I so wish they provided directions on how to open these suckers up to insert the batteries! (3 AAA--not included) TIP: half the textured base near the magnet (opposite the on/off switch) slides open. There is a faint black arrow at the opening.

The bad? These lights have three settings--flashlight, floodlight and flashing red LED lights. Two of my flashlights worked perfectly, but the flashing red LED's never worked on the third. No biggie and I'm keeping them all, but it bodes ill for the reliability.

Still, these things are so cheap I can't complain--much.
___________________________________

UPDATE--that third flashlight with the non-operational red LED's? It drained the batteries flat while turned off! Obviously a bad circuit. I threw it away. A 33% failure rate is nothing to brag about."

Kindle_Store_5,0,This was my first time reading this author and I was not disappointed. She had great dialogue and chemistry between Jaro and Roslyn and managed to create a delightfully eccentric world for them to get to know one another in. There were plenty moments where I laughed out loud and while the suspense elements of Jaro's witness protection program were slightly unbelievable it definitely did not detract from the story. My one personal request would be for a little more steamy scenes between Jaro and Roslyn but the book definitely didn't feel like it was missing anything. I would for sure reccommend this book and you really can't beat the price.

Pet_Supplies_5,0,"So, at first I hated this thing. I purchased this for my Oceanic Biocube 29 HQI and I couldn't find a good place for it. I tried the display portion, but the Aqualifter wasn't powerful enough to fill the level correctly within 0 minutes, and the water level had to change at least two centimeters before it would even kick on. I felt it was useless. Then, I relocated the sensor into the 3rd chamber. With my Tunze 9001, it's really tight in the last chamber, but it does fit and it works flawlessly. The water level is topped off about twice a day now and my salinity is stuck perfectly at 35 ppt. I've had no errors with it and I like the many 'safety' features that the controller includes.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"REVIEW OF:  TCP RLP381430WL 14W LED PAR38 40 DEGREE WET LOCATION RATED SPOT LIGHT BULB, WARM WHITE

This efficient bulb casts a nice bright light-Brightens the entire front of the house for added safety. This Light bulb's standard-sized base screwed in immediately to existing socket.

This indoor/outdoor LED light bulb exceeded expecations. Over the years energy saving bulbs have gotten better, but many still seem kind of dull and gloomy. Oftentimes, the bluish light just hurts your eyes.  How often have you consoled yourself with the thought that by compromising a nice light you are saving energy and money?  No longer.

This bulb is doing a great job of providing the outdoor porch with a nice warm, yet bright light. No creepy shadows where miscreants can hide!

A heavy bulb, it measures 5.2"" x 5.8"" x 5.9"".  It is rated to use 14 watts of energy, and at 1050 lumens it is theoretically equivalent to a incandescent 90 watt  bulb. This light bulb is fixed at that wattage and does not dim. One can expect this bulb to last about 25,000
hours.  Roughly that's about 5.7 years, assuming 12 hours of darkness a night (25,000/12/365=5.7 years.). Well, that'd be great and at $19.80 /bulb would give you outdoor weatherproof light for less than $3.50 a year.

The bulb should work well in most areas as it is rated to function at  temperatures ranging from  -4 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit.

Security is increased with brightly lit areas....................

I'd like to thank Amazon for the opportunity to review this indoor/outdoor LED light bulb that I received as a complimentary sample in exchange for this honest review.

I hope my review is helpful for you! Thanks for your time."

Books_5,1,"There are many (well, more than a dozen) cases in which a criminal suspect is convicted of the crime.  The defendants are often not charged with the crime, but the prosecutor is charged with it.  The prosecution team is a group of detectives from the FBI who investigate the crime.  They are sent to a small town in Ohio to investigate the case.  There they investigate the case and uncover the evidence.  The cases are prosecuted.  The case is eventually settled out of court for a sum of money.  The jurors are given a choice between guilty or innocent.  There is a sentence of six years in prison for the guilty defendant and five years for the innocent defendant.  The judge sentences the defendants to two years.  The case is eventually decided upon.  The jury decides whether the guilty defendant is guilty or not.  The trial is adjourned until the next trial.

Movies_and_TV_5,0,"Beware if you are a parent of a younger child.  Not sure exactly who this is geared for?  Maybe older kids and adults very into dark steampunk-style?
We knew we were in trouble when one of the first scenes the mid-wife going to deliver Jack offered the mother whiskey?  This was originally a French movie that is dubbed in English and it is weird.  There are a lot of violent and bizarre scenes.  Very mild spoilers for examples: the midwife rips Jack's frozen heart out and replaces it with a cuckoo-clock?  Lots of bullying, including stabbing in the eye.  The songs are bizarre and very mature about intense love (Jack is not supposed to fall in love as one of his three rules to protect his cuckoo clock hearteveryone knows cuckoo clocks can't fall in love without breaking!  What?).  Again, steampunk fans who are teen and up may enjoy this.  As for us, while we appreciate the Tim Burton like darkness, the story was too bizarre and too violent for us and the kids had us turn it off after the second over the top song, really wish we hadn't purchased thisif you are not sure, may want to rent."

Movies_and_TV_5,0,"I have a soft spot for GOG because I saw it when I was very young with my parents at a Drive In (not first run, but in some late-1960s re-release).

This is, honestly, NOT some long forgotten great SF treasure. This is not War Of The Worlds, or Time Machine, or Day The Earth Stood Still, or The Thing, or Invasion Of The Body Snatchers-- great films all.

GOG is a second- or even third-rate SF B-picture. It's almost one step away from being a MST3K parody. ( I haven't checked, maybe MST3K actually did parody it).

There's a lot of talk and not much action. The characters are all cardboard. The scriptwriters force the actors to deliver looooooong monolog lectures, 'explaining' nonexistent pseudo-science to an audience they must have thought were imbeciles. The dialog is stilted and chunky and amateurish.

And the zero-budget 'special effects' are GOG and MAGOG, a couple of aluminum-foil-covered-cardboard-box chest-height ""robots"" that don't even move an inch for most of their brief time onscreen.

I mean, this is a painfully awful little film.

I would never spend money to own a copy. But if you're in a nostalgic (and very forgiving, and MST3K-ish) mood, by all means see this on Instant Prime Streaming.
Feel free to jeer and boo at times, and enjoy the cheesy no-budget unintended campiness that is GOG.

Imagine yourself around 1964 parked in a grassy Drive-In with the speaker hung on your car window, surrounded by trucks and cars with tail fins, and a 35-cent deluxe bucket of popcorn with extra butter. And enjoy.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"OK.  There are multiple, varying reviews on these boots.  Some people say that they are a little big, some say they're ridiculously big... IF YOU OWN ANY OTHER TIMBERLAND SHOES OR BOOTS, JUST ORDER ONE FULL SIZE SMALLER THAN THOSE.

The confusion is that Timberlands (in every other case) run big and require you to wear a half size smaller than normal.  Therefore, if you don't own any Timberlands, order these ONE AND A HALF sizes smaller than your normal shoe size.  Period.  I usually wear a 12.  In Timberlands I wear an 11.5 and in these I needed a 10.5 (yes, this is all ridiculous and I actually can't believe I'm writing all of this right now).

Summary:
Timberlands in general - minus a half your normal size.
THESE Timberlands - minus one and a half your normal size.

These boots are awesome, light, not clunky, soft feeling footbed, nice arch support, look great and I really like them. 4 stars instead of five for the ridiculously stupid sizing and forcing me to get involved.  But it was aggravating to have to return the 11's which I bought based on some other completely unthorough reviews."

Books_5,0,"I enjoyed the storyline, compelling. The threat from any organization has one jumping at shadows and Corchado proves that he is not above the rest when it presents itself to him. I did enjoy the author's history because it parallels my own. I can empathize And true to the case that very few of us imigrants still hold on to hope that the situation in Mexico will improve for the better. It must.

The one thing that kept me from rating this book better was the constant use of translating the 'Mexicanisms' everywhere it is used. Even some that were translated already chapters before. It felt like the author was looking for wordcount buildup. The flow of the story is constantly interrupted by the translated repetitions. Like a street with too many unecessary speed humps you eventually would avoid, I stopped reading halfway through. But I do intend to pick it up down the line to finish the read. I am curious if the author got fed to the tigers."

Movies_and_TV_5,0,"This documentary is in my opinion a valuable expose of the credit card industry's ""back room"" techniques to get us consumers in debt and keep us there.  It shows the methods credit collection agencies use to get people to pay, and how those who are the least able to support a lot of debt in their lives are the most profitable people for credit card companies to get hooked into going into dept.  I learned a lot, and I think most anyone would benefit from seeing this documentary.

The two problems I had with this documentary were as follows:

First, it seems that all the average people (bankrupt or near-bankrupt consumers) interviewed in this film were portrayed as victims of the credit card industry, with no question as to how responsible or irresponsible these people might have been.  The bottom line is that credit card companies make people poor, keep them poor, and of course President Bush played right into their hands by championing the recently passed revisions to US bankruptcy laws.

The second problem I had was that although there is no narration, there are black slides with white text, and for some reason the editors picked a very hard to read font design and used it to create tiny paragraphs in the middle of a mostly black screen.  Not only that, the slides aren't up there very long, so be ready to hit the pause button on your remote so you can read the narration.

So, this documentary is worth a watch, if the price is right."

This one has a nice white finish.  I like that the hose is longer than the one I had.  The hose has a small, rubber ring that helps keep it clean.  I am really happy with this purchase.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,"WOW, you CANNOT beat the price. The quality is amazing."
Electronics_5,0,"The product design also tight, but that is an advantage and a disadvantage.
Once again decent bond has a positive force that does not fall.
However, if a little loose liquidity and more devices that users could have a great deal of fun.
And finish with gold plated and also not as bad as we thought. If only the end of the line to rca a little refined.
In general, a good line."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"I am happy with the Breeze cat box system, however it is taking some adjustment as we have 6 cats, (all rescues). Most of them get along well, as 4 of them are related, so I have luckily been able to use less litterboxes than the experts suggest, (one more litter box than you have cats). My current house is smaller than our old one, so we had to go from 5 litter boxes to 3 boxes with clumping litter. I decided to change to this system in an attempt to be cleaner overall. Because of the 6 cats to 3 boxes, I do notice a particular odor from the urine. The cats are all spayed females. I think because this is new to me, I let the pad stay too long, and I was also used to using a litter additive to counteract odor. There is of course no tracked litter all over the floor, which is great, and it is very easy to clean. None of the cats have shown any problem with the change, (I did one box at a time). I now just need to figure out which pads need changing when, based on how many cats use a particular box to urinate in. So I believe it is simply an adjustment phase. I have a feeling I will be changing these pads every couple of days, but as I said, we have 3 boxes for 6 cats. Overall I am happy with this system. I did notice that the Japanese have the same product offered with a dome cover, which would be nice. This system makes the most sense of any I have seen so far."

This is one of the better ones and it's around my usual mid-range price point.  The Havana (tobacco) scent is fabulous and unisex; my fiance says it's not an offensive scent, which is a compliment coming from him.  It burns cleanly and evenly from one side of the container to the other.  It doesn't have the best reach like a $60+ candle, but it's better than cheaper candles, and worth it for the pleasant scent.  If you're in the same room you can definitely smell it.  I would consider buying again (even though I'm continuatlly looking for a new scent)!"

Books_5,0,"I really do think the world would be a better place if everyone read this book. It connects you to violence in a sometimes disturbing way, but the overall message is one of empowerment. I admit to being more afraid than I was before I read this book, until I got to the last chapter on dismissing the kinds of fear that you don't need: worry, paranoia, and anxiety. Now I feel safe in the knowledge that I will prevent the violence I can, and live without worry of what I can't prevent. I know my life will be better for having read this book."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"I have many different sets of scrubs. I do not wear them professionally, I just wear them as pajamas and lounge wear around the house because they are so comfortable and they look a bit better than sitting around in pjs. I am always looking for new sets to add into my collection, and when I saw the MediFit Men's Basic Solid 2 Piece Top and Bottom Scrub Uniform Set, I jumped at the chance to order a set.

MediFit is one of my favorite brands for scrubs. Their quality is high and their pricing is generally lower than other brands. This set was just as good as all of the other MediFit scrubs that I have purchased. The fabric is soft and comfortable against my skin. It is made from 80% Polyester and 20% Tetron Rayon, and it is highly absorbent and wrinkle resistant, which are both definite bonuses! The fabric is also quite breathable and feels light and airy. It would be ideal for someone rushing back and forth in a hospital or doctor's office.

This set of scrubs is very roomy and it has a flattering v-neckline. The top has a roomy patch pocket, and the pants have two slash pockets, and two cargo pockets, so there is plenty of pocket space for me! The waist is drawstring, which means it can fit a pretty wide range of sizes, and the pant legs are a standard straight leg fit. The scrubs have a nice classic design, which I appreciate. I am pleased with their quality and appearance.

I must disclose that this product was received at a discounted cost for my honest and unbiased review. My opinion was not altered due to the product being discounted. If I do not believe in a product, I will not give it a positive rating. Please leave a comment if you have any further questions. Thanks for taking the time to read my review!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,"I am 6"", 160lb so this is the size I prefer.

The only reason I ordered this is because I had a friend who is 6'4"" and had a large size that fit perfectly.  It was a little big for him.  I don't know how long it would take him to get it to fit, but he is very tall.  He has already been wearing it for a while"

I'm not sure if I would have made the same decision, but I'm not sure that I would have made a bad decision if I thought this movie was going to be boring."

Electronics_5,0,Works wonderfully.  Switches quickly and flawlessly with all of my extra devices.

I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a fun, steamy read. I enjoyed this book. I love how the heroine is a strong heroine who is strong. I liked how the story was written. I liked how the main character was a strong woman. I was a little confused at first, but I found it very entertaining. I'm a huge fan of the M/M genre.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"I almost loved these shoes...I do really like them.  My 3 year old has wide feet and he really likes slip on ""boat shoes"".  The problems with those shoes are they get stinky and he falls in them.  I looked at alllll the shoes on Amazon and these were my number one choice.  Visually I love the color combination.  The velcro strap fits great and the shoes are easy for him to put on and take off by himself.  He ran like a crazy man the first time he wore them and he was super excited that he didn't fall down!  I feel like much of the comfort comes from the width in addition to the general support provided from the shoe.  My only real complain is that after a week of so the shoes had little fuzzies from the material all over the gray part of the shoe.  I'm sure I could probably pick them off, but I don't have time for that.  They are still great as far a comfort and function, they just lost the new look a bit quicker than I anticipated.  I definitely recommend these shoes for anyone who has a kiddo with wide feet!
**This is my first New Balance purchase and I will definitely check out what they have available when purchasing his next pair of shoes**

***ETA***  I purchased these shoes at the end of March.  It is now the beginning of July and I am bummed out that my kiddo has somehow worn a hole in the toe of both shoes.  They were definitely great while they lasted!"

Why didn't she get pregnant sleeping with Mitch? I kept hoping  Erin was Mitch's daughter but alas... She kept saying that she ""grew to love her husband"" - that old pervert who wanted 20 years younger wife and married her knowing she was in love with someone else. Yuck! He was a good person?

Pet_Supplies_5,0,"Just switched my cat to this food and he really likes it. He's eating it more than the Purina One Beyond he upgraded from. The vet suggested to give him Innova Evo or Blue Buffalo which are both excellent foods but he didn't like them and he actually dropped down to 9.5 lbs. He's slowly gained weight back after switching to Purina One Beyond but I wanted to buy something that was a great quality food rather than the supermarket junk he likes. Purina One Beyond is better quality than Friskies or something but still not the quality I want my pets to eat.

He is now 10.6 lbs and rising so I'm hoping that he'll eventually get up to the 12 lbs that the vet wanted him at to be ideal weight (he's a large breed cat).

Price was $3 more expensive than the Purina, so he gets a 5 star food at a great price!
I noticed that other reviewers said their cats' poop smelled horrible after eating this but Ziggy's poop doesn't smell horrible or strong at all. Probably just depends on your cat I guess. My other cat sneaks some of his food sometimes and it didn't change her poop either. She uses a pee pad because she refuses to use a litter box so I'd definitely notice if her poop smelled stronger!"

Electronics_5,0,"Before I got this device I needed three remotes to control my tv/home theater system. Now that I have it I need... three remotes to control my tv/home theater system.
I'll give them one of the controllers - only my tv's original remote controls aspect ratio (my educational dvds are in 4:3) and I am unaware of universals that fulfill that function.
But this remote won't allow me to change the input on my receiver. I still need the original receiver remote to do that. If there is a way to do it, I haven't figured it out. And although the manual says they are ready to assist by phone or emai, they don't answer the phone, nor emails.
btw, if you set up the power button to punch through and turn on more than one device, you have to learn the timing. If you press the button too quickly the entire macro won't run and not all devices will turn on. If you press it too long the macro will continue running and turn some devices back off. In either case you will be out of sync, and can only get back in sync manually (or by using an original remote) to get the devices lined up in the proper on/off state as designed by your macro.
  I'll keep the remote because the power button on the original receiver remote has gone south and I need that functionality. Otherwise this remote solves no problems for me, and now I have to operate the system for those family members who are not ""technical""."

The only thing I would change is that it was a little bit too large for my machine. I found it was a bit too small for the machine and it would not fit on the standard suction cup.

I do not recommend this suction cup at all. I have not used it yet, but I have used it a few times and it is well worth the money.

Pros:
-Easy to use
-Convenient to use

-Easy to use
-Cons:
-Made of cardboard
-Wish the suction cup had a spout

Toys_and_Games_5,0,"A friend and I pulled this out of the box when it arrived to see if we could find a way for adults to use it... I was thinking Fimo decorative beads, and while it will initially be fun and helpful, I don't see an adult using it for long when a small rolling pin can do almost the same thing.

That said, the novelty of it is really fun - both for us as Moms, and for kids, who will undoubtedly will have fun with this for a while.

Comes with findings to make some things once you create your beads, clay (air-dry), tools and the machine."

Kindle_Store_5,0,This group of peppers seem to have their act together - but only time will tell. Very goof story line and character development. Already thrown in some bumps in the road. This is a great set up for the the books to come. I really enjoyed the story line and the characters. My kind of people. They are trying to help others versus buttoning up. I am already waiting for the next book. Please hurry.

I'm much too old to be watching such things but this movie brings delight to movie lovers of all ages. I hear debate over the merits of the Fox version vs. the Disney version. I think they are both excellent but I prefer the Disney version because the video is slightly better. Other than that, there is no perceptible difference."

He wears it often and it's comfortable. I ordered the XS which is a size 9. 5 and it fits him perfectly. He is a size 6. 5 and it fits him perfectly. He wears a size 10 in jeans and a size 11 in leggings and these fit him perfectly. It's very comfortable. I got this for my son for Christmas. He absolutely loves it!This is a great size. It's very comfortable. I have a wide foot and it's great that it's not too narrow. The material is a soft and thick material and I can wear it all day. I was able to wear it with leggings and with a pair of jeans. I'm 5'2"" and the top part of the shoe is a little wide. I normally wear a size 10 in jeans and it's perfect. I usually wear a 9. 5 in leggings but this was perfect. The material is soft and very soft and I can wear it all day. The fabric is very soft and nice quality. I got the leggings in a small and they fit perfectly. They are well made and I like that they are made of a nice material."

Electronics_5,0,"After 4 months!  Sometimes I go several days without using it. When I do use it, it may be for only 5 minutes or up to 90 minutes.  But, its got enough hours on it that I was VERY impressed at the battery life.  I use it 100% for podcasts.  Usually it sits in the cup holder of my truck to listen to while driving or I use it while doing household work like washing dishes or putting away laundry.  For these tasks, it works awesome!  It pairs very easily to my ipod touch 4 as well as my iphone 5.  It is an excellent product for the way I use it.  A negative is when I paired it with my Vizio TV I was unable to adjust the sound.  The speaker has no sound adjustments and my TV volume would not work with it.  Also, I don't know why some people rave over the cup, seems like about a 50 cent cup to me:/

Electronics_5,0,"This is the exact screen that came with my Samsung purchase of this awesome chromebook. My screen broke and I was contemplating buying a totally new laptop, until I found how easy this would be, to remove and replace the screen and pay only 1/4 amount of the computer, which was such a good buy for the price in the first place. So long as the model # and the brackets match your current (broken) screen, you will be fine. But please, do it yourself, because if you go and pay for someone to replace your screen, you have just given away money. It took me 5 minutes on youtube watching the video, 5 minutes removing my own screen, 5 minutes to order the new one, 3 business days to receive the screen via regular shipping, and 5 minutes to put the new screen in. That's exactly 3 business days and 15 minutes for a perfect solution and a chromebook that works like new!"
Books_5,1,Another winner from Michael Perry!  I love the way he explains how to make a movie!  Can't wait for the next book!What a great book!  I was very impressed with this book. It was written in a very enjoyable style. I found it very easy to read. I liked the characters and the story line.

Electronics_5,0,"I have owned this camera for 4 years now.

Pros - Beautiful landscapes.
  Amazing outdoor shots and colors
  Easy to carry. Good response time. Good video too.
I have made a few trips, shot photos/videos at a couple of marriages and the comments on my landscape shots have generally been 'which camera do you have? Wooh that's costly for a non-SLR camera but the landscape shots are surely good.'

Cons- Indoor shots suck big time, flash power is too weak. I used a extra flash which had multiple levels but the light level indoors would either come too bright or weak and it would be just right only a few times.

I had bought it for around 600+ dollars(including the cost of accessories) when it had come out and was impressed by its build quality. It really looks cool and compact. But it turns out the prices of compactness is paid in the life of the camera. Since the lens retracts back and out it has a good chance of getting damaged. It looks like some sensors(battery/door/lens sensors) have got damaged.

That moving part stopped working a few weeks back. It does not start up and the repair cost will be at least half the cost of a good new camera. I have film cameras bought buy my dad's uncle at a yard sale in the 1950s that still work fine. I was expecting this camera to last me for at least 10 years. I am very disappointed that it has become unusable in 4 years.

I would have loved to give this camera at least 4 stars but wanted to give it only 1 for not being durable. Finally I am giving it 2 for at least good 4 years of service. They don't make them like they used to anymore. Will be trying a Nikon next."
Toys_and_Games_5,1,My 7 year-old daughter loves this toy and she has been playing with it for a couple of years now.  The only thing I wish was a bit more plastic
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"The costume was cute the gloves fit pretty well and the dress itself was very nice my biggest complaint was that the dress overall was tight.  I am grateful for the stretchy fabric which allowed me to still wear it and be comfortable so I would recommend ordering larger than your size.  another pet peeve was the amount of glitter coming off of the dress on to my skin and when I took the dress off all of the residual black glitter .

Another reason I gave it a three was for the wig it was awful it was a few pieces of yarn barely could cover my head and didn't look right and not to mention all of the glitter that kept coming off of it everywhere and the strands of yarn that also fell out."
Electronics_5,1,It's really sad. That this Blu-ray player has the quality to be considered a top tier player in the market. I had a friend who was a video-game enthusiast and he was skeptical that it was worth his money. I decided to try it out and see if it would be worth the money. I was disappointed because it was a $100 player with a 3D-capable drive.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"I've been wearing this suit for about two and a half months swimming in a school pool for aout half an hour 2-3 days a week (rinsing thoroughly after with tap water and hand washing once a week) and the material is wearing thin, sorry to have to look for a replacement so soon, but it was a great starter suit while I decided whether I would stick with the swimming!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"I am a C-4 quadriplegic and the users backpack to carry pretty much everything I need for the day on the back of either my power chair or manual wheelchair. Backpack is very comfortable and forms well to my back. Pockets are all very easily accessible (I don't have hand function but I can easily access any pocket in this backpack.)  The weight sits really nicely high on my back and doesn't feel like it pulling me into bad posture.
While the bag is relatively expensive, Arcteryx goods are always high quality and last years.
I would definitely recommend this bag to anyone looking for a 22 L bag to use as a day bag."
Toys_and_Games_5,1,It's not entirely wood.  We have the Brio and the Queen.  The Brio has a little more shape and is more flexible.  The Queen is a bit of a gooey mess.  It's a little more delicate.  My daughter is still happy with her Brio.  I think it's cute and I'd be happy with it for her birthday.We love this set.  It's a great way to get some cool party favors and a bunch of fun items to play with.

Movies_and_TV_5,1,"Count Dracula is to my mind a master story, and I will admit that I thought this one.

But the film is a bit too long, and the first half is pretty much just a matter of time.  I would have liked to have seen more of the story, but I felt that it was just too long, and had to wait a bit for the second half.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a long film, and not for those who have never seen Dracula before, but for those who know that it is indeed a beautiful story, and will watch it over and over.  It is not too long, and it is filled with good ideas, and the characters are believable.

Overall, this is a good film, and I recommend it to everyone who has seen Dracula before, and for those who have"
Toys_and_Games_5,0,"The Click N Play Doll Scooter and Helmet set comes in 5 pieces. The handlebars snap into the base which already has the back wheels on it. The front wheel is a quick snap in the front and your scooter is ready for a doll. It also has a helmet and googles.

We love the colors and the quality.

The goggles are awesome and so cute.  They look like the ones my daughter uses.

This set can be used with any 18 inch size dolls.

This will be a Christmas gift for my daughter so I hope to take another photo when it is all together but it comes separated in white box with no picture or markings other than to say it is a scooter. Perfect for wrapping.

My daughter is going to love that it has a helmet and Goggles. She was just talking about a pair for her dolls.

Pros:

Well made thick plastic
Easy to put together
Fun colors
Great Price
Quick Shipping

Cons
The box should have some advertising on it. It makes it appear cheap but the set looks anything but cheap.

Kindle_Store_5,0,"This is a gift from the author, so people can see what her style is like.  Clean romance, and realistic characters.  There is a sweetness about the story and the writing.

Sweet romance is probably a better term for the writer's style.  She has an eye for detail that brings the people to life.  And she has an eye for attraction so she can communicate it in suble ways.

In this day and age of porn, filth, debasing fiction, this writer is a relief and a reassurance that goodness still lives in the world.  I've read some of her other books, novels, and they are just as clean, lovely and romantic."

It is a bit dimmer than the Schlage version, but I've had it for about a year now and I like the idea of having a ""taste"" of the bulb.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"If you ever peel potatoes you have to have this. It is such a good peeler.
I bought so many expensive peelers- I have the peeler graveyard but all those expensive ones are no good because they gouge the flesh of fruits and vegetables. Use this!! it just skims the fruit or veg. so you only peel the skin and you have the fruit or veg. in tact.
Fresh thin carrots are the test- those other peelers gouged the carrot so you would see the middle. Use this because you can safely peel without ruining the carrot. You can sweep it back and forth rather fast also- it does a great job!!!!!!!"

Kindle_Store_5,0,"For much of my life, I have wanted to write a book and get it published.  Writing it was not a problem.  Publishing it was a problem, and when I read Steve's book, ""How to Discover Best-Selling Nonfiction eBook Ideas"", it had all the information I needed to get it done.  And it is done!  I am a published author.  And ... there are more books on the way!

 What I really liked about this book, and others by Steve Scott, is that not only does he give the answers to my questions, but he also gives a step-by-step tutorial on how to make it work.  Most books just give an answer, assuming that I will know what they mean and be able to figure it out for myself.  But Steve goes a step beyond that.

I can, without pause, give a STRONG recommendation to everyone who has a dream as I did, to write a book, read this first.  You'll be off on the right foot.

Thanks, Steve, for sharing your insights.  :)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Piano-Its-Purchase-and-Care/dp/B00AOSFJY0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Piano - Its Purchase and Care</a>"

Kindle_Store_5,0,"I'm an Oprah junkie, so I absolutely loved this. Her whole background is so tragic. I knew quite a bit about her before reading this, but I definitely learned more details. I had no idea she had a brother that died and that was a very sad story. The last chapter on life lessons from Oprah is worth keeping somewhere for inspiration. Great intro read into Oprah world."
Books_5,0,"Scathing, dark, and raucous, ""Let's Pretend This Never Happened"" is easily my favorite in a long time.  Imaging Neil Gaiman and Stephen Colbert narrating your (mostly true) life story, and you'll see the brilliance of Lawson's work.  Sometimes it's quick-turn-around funny and other times is a wandering journey without a word wasted.  Definitely worth the read."

Kindle_Store_5,1,"While I am not really into the whole ""towards a happy ending"" thing, I am a big fan of the fairy tale.  The heroine is a strong, strong, strong heroine.

She is very protective of her family and the town and the town. "
Toys_and_Games_5,0,"A great toy in principle - it holds up in the wash, and there are lots of ways for your baby to play with it.  However, my son would play with this for 1 min tops before tossing it aside.  At least for my son, if it doesn't make lights or noise, fuggedaboudit."
Movies_and_TV_5,0,Very entertaining movie! Loved it and can't wait for the next Chapter!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,Love this peeler.  I had purchased one a few years ago and somehow it got lost.  I tried to replace it with other brands and they just didn't do the job as well.  This time I purchased two just in case.  Would recommend it to everyone.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"I was pleasantly surprised with these coveralls. I was hoping the would not be super thin material and easy to zip. I was not let down! I love how everything is connect, these are not 3 separate pieces. Just ONE piece, so easy to just slide the booties over your shoes, then pull up the coveralls, zip to desired area, and hoodie over head. I use this during a deep purge of a house with lots of dust, dander and allergens."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"I have switched my dog from a mix of hills science diet and Rachel ray grain free nutrish (salmon)  to this over the past week.  He is a growing Bassett hound, 10 mo;  I know not everyone would consider this a large breed because  he is short, but I know that his breed can get up to 70 pounds full-grown.  He seems to like  The flavor so far, but he is not a terribly picky eater. I have been transitioning him  slowly on a graduated mix;  I have noticed that his stools, while still formed, have been a lot softer on the Iams mix.  Some of this I realize has to do with any kind of dietary change,  so I will wait a little longer before giving my final opinion on that. This product lost only one star because the grain size makes this food a little harder to eat than others (including Eukanuba large breed, which he has tried before).  Other than that, it is a good product at a fair price and keeping my dog nourished at his high activity level.

Update:  dog still likes it and his poops are nice and firm, but the problem is that the grain size is so large, it is clogging my auto feeder. For that reason alone, I cannot buy it again."

I am a runner, but even if I go out in the evenings to walk, I will wear this.  Our neighborhood is very safe, but not well lit.  Oncoming cars can easily see me when I wear this.

This is not a ""best"" game, but it's well worth the price.  I recommend this for all ages.Cute, fun game for our little ones!  We have been playing it a few times now and it has been a favorite.  It is a fun game for all ages"
Electronics_5,0,"Not a bad little device. I have owned this MP3 player for several days now and it is everything I expected it to be. Loading music is astonishingly easy. the 15 GB of storage will take me quite a while to fill up. There is an SD card slot that I don't expect that I will ever have reason to use. I did not test the device with an SD card but I shook it down in every other way. I've dropped it a few times (not intentionally) and it survived intact. The audio quality is fine and the radio adequate. I mostly listen to my local college station which is within ten miles of my home, it plays that very well. The scroll through menu is logical and easy to read. My only negatives were that it is virtually impossible to read in bright sunlight and the menu when going from MP3 player to other features is not as straightforward as I would like. Also MP3 player is the default mode. If you turn it off set to the radio, when you turn it on again it will be set in MP3 mode. That is not really a bug, but it is a bit of an annoyance. All around it is well worth four stars."

Books_5,0,"Be Careful What You Wish For is a nicely done concept about Heather Hamilton, who comes by some ""lucky heather"" from a gypsey, and watches in amazement as her entire life begins to change. Traffic jams clear up, the perfect pink shoes appear -- and so does the perfect man!

But, sometimes what you wished for is not as dear as what finds you by mere ""mortal means."" And when issues of life and death enter the picture, Heather's view of what is important radically changes, bringing into focus what truly matters.

Alexandra Potter has provided readers with some fun moments and cute characters that move the story along nicely. It's an entertaining, light read."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,"Many a yoga class has a bunch of guys and they all need to make a change.  I've seen some people complain about the ""creepy"" part of the belt, but it's okay.  It's a thin elastic fabric.  This is a great belt for the money.  I have a few other belts I'd recommend to anyone who needs a belt that will last a long time.  I do think that the compression may be a little more comfortable for some people, but I don't think so.  I'm a big guy, so I usually wear a medium, and a large, and they all have a lot of compression.  I wear a medium, and this belt does a good job of keeping my waist in line with my body.

Pet_Supplies_5,0,"These are good at creating bubbles. However, they start ""shedding"" with moderate use and cleaning. My hydroponic reservoir had a little bit of algae in it, so I needed to clean the airstone as well. Bits and pieces kept coming off of it. After the cleaning, I noticed bits of the airstone falling off into the reservoir every day.

Considering these are less than a dollar each, it's not the worst thing in the world. However, I really would prefer they didn't ""shed"" into my tank."
Electronics_5,0,"I received this UPS a couple days ago and found it was fully charged when I received it.  This is my first Tripp Lite UPS.  I have been a loyal APC user for my entire computing life.  I figured I would see if TL is any better.  I was surprised that the battery was already hooked up and fully charged when the device arrived.  I let it run for two days.  First day had no load and second had a minimal load.  Tonight I installed the unit in my media center.  So far I have had no issues and no smell as reported by others.  I currently use this UPS in my media center to keep a TV, sound system, CATV box and DVD running.  Current full load is without the DVD and usage is at 37%.  With everything turned off, I still see a draw of 9%.

The only thing that is slightly annoying, and why I gave this item a 4-star review, is that I cannot figure out how to turn off the LCD display when I did not need it.  It is a nice night light in the living room, but I would rather have the display go out automatically or even manually.  I read documentation offline and online and found no clues.  I sent an email to tech support but haven't heard anything after 3 days.  Guess I will call their Chicago phone number and ask.  Unfortunately I only remember to call after they close.

Otherwise, the unit seems to be solid.  Minus the inability to figure out how to turn off the display, I am happy with my purchase.  Time will tell if I switch to Tripp Lite, try someone else or go back to APC."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"The price was good for the wattage of this UV Sterilizer. It arrived promptly. Once it was installed it took about a week for the water to change from green to white. After that it was about another week before the water cleared. I am running a Saltwater type Wet Dry filter with Bio Balls which might have contributed to the green water. Also during the first two weeks I ran the UV Sterilizer 24 hours a day. After the water cleared I put it on the same timer as the Lights are on, this should help the sterilizer bulb to last longer. Overall I am very pleased with the Green Killing Machine. The only problem I have is that I wish the power cord was a little longer."

Movies_and_TV_5,0,"Based on a novel by the team of Nordhoff and Hall, this dreary film was an obvious attempt to duplicate the success of MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY, also based on a novel by the same duo.

Unfortunately, the resulting film is very dull and is only partly redeemed by good performances, but even James Mason cannot quite save it."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Well I've had this installed for a few months. Ended up purchasing 6 more dimmers. The HomeKit interface is great. The overall quality has met my expectations for the current products on the market. My biggest tangible complaint is the wall switches have a cheap feel. The remotes feel more sturdy and less wobbly when you press the buttons. The app works well on the iPhone and watch. Siri is a bonus but Apple needs to work on their side of the integration a little more. Most of the time I can use Siri quickly for dimming or turning the lights on. The app needs some improvement with the geo location. I added my girlfriend to the app. However, I have the app programmed to turn the lights off when I leave. If my girlfriend is home it still turns them off. Not big deal but this would be a pain if you have a big family. You can easily turn this feature off if you don't like it. Lutron if you're listening please keep improving the app and hub integration with other products. Bonus points if you program an alarm clock dimmer. Overall, the best you can get for the price and quality level. 5 stars based on that fact. The reality is its more of a 4."

Toys_and_Games_5,0,"My children enjoyed this game when they were in the 2 to 4 year old range. There's a little memory practice going on combined with color matching.

To play the game a bunch of cardboard fish are placed color side down in the center of the play area. Each player is given a plastic boat with 4 slots in it. Players use a plastic fishing pole with a suction cup on the end to pick up fish from the center. If the fish matches their boat's color the player gets to put the fish in his or her boat. If it doesn't match the color then the fish goes back into the center. This is where the memory aspect comes in. The other players need to remember where a fish was placed back in the center if it happened to be of their color. It doesn't take much memory to remember one fish location until your turn comes around, but this is really for the very youngest game players. The first player to fill their boat wins. There is a variant that lets it use the numbers on the colored fish to play the classic go fish game of making sets and asking other players for matches. This variant stretches the age appropriateness up to maybe 4 years old. The Go Fish game lost its appeal for my children once the youngest was 4. They moved on to more advanced memory games like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Magic-Labyrinth-Board-Game/dp/B003RDJYMM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Magic Labyrinth Board Game</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hide-and-Eeek/dp/B003D7EPQM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hide and Eeek</a>&nbsp;after that.

The pieces are colorful and attractive. The game lasted fine through a couple of years of use. The suction cup worked okay for us. The game would probably work fine in a preschool classroom.

All in all it's a fun little game for the very youngest of gamers at a cheap price."

We are taking then on a long train ride from NY to San Diego with stops in Grand Canyon, lots of kid things in San Diego. I am a travel nanny by trade so being prepared is my motto!  They needed backpacks just big enough to carry a couple bottles of water an a good supply of snacks for hikes and carry their Fire for train rides. I thought this was going to be too small at first. But I easily put a bottle on outside and inside plus my Fire and plenty of room for snacks, some playing cards etc. The back has a small padded feature. I wondered if straps would fit 7 yr old and I can adjust to even fit me! Best part? So light even with stuff that even my 5 year old won't complain! The stretchy from cords can even carry a small stuffed animal for sleep later.

I will do an update after trip (if still alive) and give feedbacks. With kids, go as small as you can and still do the job!

Update: These were perfect and now after trip they use it on long bike rides with dad.

I liked it so much that I got one for myself for my Scotland trip in Oct. I can not do heavy backpacks and when out being a tourist, purses are a bother. Great for plane as will hold a travel blanket, fire and tablet, phone and cords plus a bottle.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,I bought these boots for my girlfriend and she was very excited to receive such a lovely gift. She loves that they go on so easily and yet they are incredibly secure once they are laced up. They come in a variety of colors but the blue color we chose is a lovely pairing with any type of denim. They are made fairly well and have held up great so far in their use. The pocket on the boots is great too since it provides a place to stash money or a small set of keys when you don't want to or can't put them elsewhere. She states that they are quite comfortable but despite this she still chose to put a set of cushioning insoles in them. She does this with all of her shoes and boots though. She had worn them for the better part of eight hours and was happy with how great her feet felt despite being active for so long. My girlfriend certainly didn't need another set of boots but these ones are worth having. I think they look great on her and she is quite happy with how they look and feel on herself as well.  I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and fair review of the item and I have found myself to be very happy with my purchase.

The romance elements don't really kick in until the halfway mark, leaving most of the book to focus on other aspects of the protagonist's life, what romance there is isn't overbearing or unrealistic. A plot twist 3/4 through helps keep things fresh with an unexpected change of setting for the final act. The book is largely well-written, but there are some poor descriptive techniques scattered about (""as cold as January"" was a particularly bland simile that stuck in my mind).

Where the book disappoints is in the drama. Most elements of the plot had me wondering why these characters care even half as much as they apparently do. The protagonist is a 17-year-old illegitimate daughter of a recently-deceased nobleman who's been sent by her step-mother to live in a convent. This is problematic for our hero because the only thing she wants on this world is to find a man to marry. A more charitable reviewer would say that she's realistically very focused given the options for those in her situation, but her one-track-mind struck me as obsessive and overly dramatic. The aforementioned plot twist is fairly transparent (if you're expecting a twist), and the while the MacGuffin around which the twist is centered may be historically accurate in terms of its importance, it seemed fairly trivial to me and fed into the overall feeling of unnecessary drama.

The protagonist's personal conflicts are sure to resonate with many readers, particularly girls around her age and younger. Readers who have an interest in art, particularly painting, might understand the drama better, and will definitely appreciate the author's descriptions of the art and architecture. The ending could be interpreted as slightly preachy, but it doesn't detract from the book."

Some chips appear to have already been badly touched up with not-quite-matching touch up paint, and others aren't fixed at all. I read this in other reviews for this bike, so I guess it's quite common.
The chipped paint didn't occur in transit, as the bike was very well protected in foam, cardboard and plastic.
The bike still functions and went together fine, but don't expect the paint to be in good condition.

Books_5,0,"Somewhat reminiscent of The Book of Lost and Found, by Lucy Foley, Cooking For Picasso weaves a tale rooted in the mother-daughter relationship, with mystery, heartbreak, and romance in lovely Mediterranean landscapes all blended together in an entertaining tale.

I liked the parallel structure of the book, switching back and forth in time from the modern-day part of the story in which the granddaughter, Cline, is dealing with her mothers poor health, her conniving half-siblings (characters who come up just short of comic-opera levels of villainy), and a search in the French Riviera town of Juan-les-Pins for a mysterious bequest from her grandmother Ondine.

The book is somewhat uneven in structure and execution, trying just a little too hard at times to sustain the edge and the mystery, casting one too many stumbling blocks in the way as Cline delves into her mothers and het grandmothers pasts, and delving a time or two into some quite frankly erotic scenes which, while not offensive were rather graphic, and a bit out of character with the rest of the book. All those things having been said, this book is a delightful read, over all, which has me pining for a Provenal vacation!"
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"I have seven cats, no dogs. I sometimes get these purebites that are marketed to dogs because the bags are so much bigger. The pieces in the ""dog"" ones are bigger & sometimes harder than the ones for cats. I do  have to break up the big pieces and eliminate the really hard ones, but it is such a good value that it seems worth the extra work.

edit 4/8/16- when I got towards the bottom of the bag some of the pieces were VERY hard and not usable for cats. Probably just fine for most dogs since they love chewing on even harder things like bones... but I think I will stick to the cat version for my cats in the future."

I find myself playing with it when I'm supposed to be cleaning up the play room.

Pet_Supplies_5,1,"While our daughter is serving time in the US, we've tried a lot of different foods and we've found that the best thing for her to get through her food bowl is to go to the bathroom and look at the food in her bowl. If she doesn't like the food, she'll eat it.

Our daughter also loves the chicken and rice dishes. She has a tendency to just eat the chicken and rice dishes and that's fine because she loves the food. She doesn't like the chicken and rice dishes, but she does like the chicken and rice dishes.

Overall, it's a great bowl that doesn't have a lot of waste. It's a bit difficult to clean, and we're using the same bowl for our dog. It's also a bit heavier, so it's not the best for small dogs.

Electronics_5,0,"These screen protectors definitely do their job, as do most; however, I just can't seem to justify these for my Kindle Touch. (Especially in consideration of a few outstanding faults)

The most annoying aspect of this particular product was that it was not a very precise fit whatsoever. The Kindle Touch uses a good deal of perimeter screen area for display, which makes having nearly one centimeter clearance on each side of a centered screen protector application extremely annoying and difficult to overlook. If they were perfectly clear, it may be a little easier for others to overlook, but the translucence is ever so slightly different than the screen itself. I removed my screen protector immediately after application.

I must note that I often and gladly employ the use of screen protectors whenever reasonably applicable, particularly with touch screen cell phones, but when it comes to the Kindle Touch I'm not too sure if they truly serve any degree of necessary function at all. With most book-like e-reader covers (mine being the standard ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amazon-Kindle-Touch-Leather-Cover-Black/dp/B004SD22PQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amazon Kindle Touch Leather Cover, Black</a>"" - of which I am EXTREMELY happy with), the only time the screen is actually exposed would be when the Kindle is in use. In this case, the annoyance of a poorly fitting screen protector doesn't come close to outweighing the slim risk of anything happening to the screen in conjunction with a proper cover and/or case.

In summation: If you find that you need a screen protector and don't mind that it only covers 95% of the screen, then this product should certainly suffice - 3 stars for the sake of advertised purpose fulfillment."

Pet_Supplies_5,0,"After discovering how harmful rawhide chews, treats, bones etc. I went on a search to find a healthy alternative for my 3 mo. old puppy. I was amazed to find how healthy sweet potato strips and fries were for all dogs as there are no harmful ingredients in them and they contain no other ingredients except sweet potato, period. At first my dog was confused, however offering nothing else but the sweet potato, she quickly decided to give them a try. She takes them to her bed and enjoys them tremendously. Biting off small pieces and chewing each piece thoroughly and completely before swallowing. The bag contains a lot of strips, and lasts a long time.  I will never give my dog any type of rawhide, and my wish is that people would just research how rawhide of any type is processed from beginning to end, and they will discover how harmful if not deadly rawhide is for your beloved pet. Giving sweet potato is 100% natural without any threat to your dog's health, not to mention that they are tasty snack and treat to offer your dog, and it's important to know they are made in the USA, and reading the label for ingredients, you will immediately realize this is the right choice of chew and treat to give your beloved dog.

Books_5,0,"I give five stars to Joby Warrick's The Triple Agent.  Warrick writes without political agenda, bias, or sensationalism.  In clear language, Warrick tells how tells how the CIA was duped by physician-turned-suicide bomber Humam Balawi.  Warrick conducted over two hundred interviews, on three continents, to piece together Walawi's story.  Yet, despite the incredible amount of information Warrick amassed, he tells the story in a clear, but intelligent, manner.

While most of The Triple Agent is well-documented, here and there Warrick did engage in speculation.  Speculation which has a logical bais, but which cannot be verified.  For instance, Warrick reports what Balawi saw at a border crossing and what he saw in his rear view mirror.  Balawi may have seen things exactly as Warrick claims, but as Balawi is dead there is no way to know for sure.
Still, given that the overall storyline is well-documented, such petty speculations are benign.

In short, The Triple Agent is well worth reading for anyone anyone interested in Al-Qaeda and modern spycraft."

Pros: The body of the screw driver is fat for good torque, and the handle is easy on the hands. The tips are hard and durable so they will last for a long time.

Cons: Its heavier than a regular screw driver it's size, but when you think about it, it's taking up the roles of 10 tools.

Movies_and_TV_5,0,"I Compare this movie to inception because tht was the last sci-fi action movie I saw that was better than I was expecting (and I was expecting a lot). This is a solid adult sci-fi flick. The first act of the film is intriguing and shows a lot of promise. It plays out a little slower more in a drama fashion or the middle third of the film. And the third act is not as satisfying as it could have been.

As a reviewer on Rottentomatoes mentioned, this is like a mashup of other classic sci-fi films. Terminator, 12 Monkeys and Firestarter immediately spring to mind. It's a good movie, do not get me wrong, but I would go with low expectations and you might find that there are some interesting concepts at play (poor Seth).

Finally!  I came across this moisture wicking Thorlo sock that has most of the same padding especially in the bottom areas.  He put them on after a race.  Now, let me tell you after a race, he is sweating so much he looks like he just stepped out of a shower.  Amazingly, his feet remained dry even though he was soaking wet everywhere else.  Afterwards, these socks did not pollute the laundry basket like the soaked cotton socks.  His only concern is they don't have quite as much padding on the top of the sock as his other cotton Thorlos so they may not be good for running down hills, but we don't have a lot of hills where we live.  So that isn't a problem unless we start travelling to running races again."

Wish it was a little longer - maybe 8 to 10 ft. The product did come rolled nicely in the plastic packaging, so it wasn't twisted or tangled. I'd recommend packing it the same way when storing your Christmas decorations. Each twig of pine is individually attached to the main branch, which I'm not a fan of, but for the price, it's an adequate decor item. Will post photo soon.

Kindle_Store_5,1,"This book is for sailboat readers and the reader must read it.

The author has done a great job of describing the sea.  The descriptions are clear and easy to understand.  The author does not leave the reader hanging on the last page.  I recommend this book.I was looking forward to reading the book"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,It was my mistake I didn't think about it being a foot long which is way longer than I needed.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,Fits well.  Just a plain black pump.  Not especially stylish but fits my need for a plain black pump.
Pet_Supplies_5,1,had to readjust thinking because it has the same materials. I will keep this for the next couple of months. Great product!Works great.
Movies_and_TV_5,0,"After viewing ""His Last Vow,""  I am left absolutely stunned and I cannot wait to see what happens next.  I sympathize with fellow reviewers who have been disappointed to see a Sherlock that is less than heroic; less ""in control.""  However, his behavior in Season 3 just goes to show how important John Watson is to the stability and grounding of an almost out of control force that is Sherlock Holmes.  There are moments in ""His Last Vow"" that are simply heartbreaking to watch. The plot is completely unpredictable and left me on the edge of my seat.  Despite many harrowing moments, what carries the day is that these two friends clearly understand and trust each other despite their suffering.  This goes beyond a simple ""bromance.""  This relationship is epic and makes this version of Sherlock Holmes the most compelling I've seen.  The supporting cast is wonderful and I am glad that Mycroft, Molly, Lestrade and Mrs. Hudson have been given more screen time."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,"This has definitely made a difference in the quality of my coffee.  I have a strong cup of coffee and am very happy with the quality and the price.  I would definitely recommend this product.  It is a good value for the price.I bought this to replace a broken one I bought a year ago. I did not want the old one to become a complete mess. I wanted a great, functional, inexpensive, and strong coffee"
Books_5,0,"Oh how this would have benefited from editing to reduce the detail, add more action and lower the page count. I had to take a break after Part Two and read another book before returning to Part Three. I did want to know how it ended but it was a chore to finish."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"This was a lifesaver when I was adjusting my pom puppy to her new home! She was stressed and didn't eat much, but LOVES this stuff. Be careful not to get it in their hair! She was so excited for it she ran right into it and got it in there. It was super hard to brush out."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"These are great, cheap sunglasses for cycling. They fit well with good wrap-around coverage. Rubber grips on the earpieces keep them firmly in place whether on my head or stuck into my helmet. The fact that they are so cheap means I don't care if they get damaged or lost (so far not yet!)."

Toys_and_Games_5,0,My 9 year old loves imaginative play with this doll and her other mermaid doll from the same line.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,I have a small collection of these..from different sources. This one turned out to be made the way all of them should be..it had a mirror lens...a TRUE Q5 led.  I compared it to my other Q5 flashlights..and noticed the led size was smaller in my others..obviously they are putting whatever led they want in these so your taking a chance. But this one..was amazing..it was just as bright as my large T6 led flashlight..at about half the size. Guess I just got lucky..but there is a difference in all of them..so just remember..your rolling the dice when you order one.
Toys_and_Games_5,1,I got this toaster for my 9 year old son. He loves it! He loves to throw the other two at the kid. The only problem is the plastic is so thin it's hard to put it back on. The kid can't use it as a kitchen sink. The kids also love to put the other two at the kitchen sink. The kids also love to play with the microwave and just pretend to make fun sounds. The kids really like it! It's very easy to put together.
Electronics_5,1,"If you still enjoy recording, you might want to try this one.

The only downside is that it's very small.

Books_5,0,"Boston Medical Examiner Maura Isles is called to a gruesome scene early on Christmas morning, where a young woman has been brutally killed and dismembered, with satanic symbols all around her body and the Latin word ""Peccavi"" (I have sinned) scrawled backwards across her bedroom wall. Detective Jane Rizzoli, back on the job after maternity leave, suspects a serial killer is on the loose when Maura's nemesis, psychiatrist Joyce O'Donnell, is murdered in the same manner. Dr. O'Donnell was part of a group of scholars from around the world calling themselves the Mephisto Club that track demons. When members of this group are murdered and Maura's life is threatened, the action moves to Europe in search of a young woman whom the Mephisto Club is certain will draw the demon to them.

This captivating thriller touches on a fascinating subject: demonology, its origins and presence in the world today. Gerritsen's outstanding characterization is once more on display along with a thrilling, fast-paced plot. Jane Rizzoli remains a strong character, a jaded woman whose marriage and baby have become a calming force. Maura is a lonely woman intrigued by a priest, and this relationship is a painful one for Maura as well as the reader, who longs for Maura's happiness. Gerritsen offers a galvanizing look at Rizzoli's parents, the two people who shaped her, which helps the reader understand her cynicism and insecurities. An electrifying read."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,1,I bought for a gift and it arrived on time. I will keep it for myself and my husband
Movies_and_TV_5,0,So glad to find such a beautifully done production. I love the English countryside and all that goes with it. Great story line and beautiful scenery. Fun to see Brendan Coyle aka Mr. Bates of Downton fame. before anyone knew of Downton Abbey.

Electronics_5,1,"If you don't need much, this is an excellent value for the money. I would recommend this product. I had a lot of trouble with the TV and the cover was very flimsy. It was hard to get the cover to come off. This was an excellent purchase. I bought this to replace the TV I had installed in my house."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,Gift arrived without bands.  Was intended to be a Christmas present.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"They were the quality I had hoped for ... not too thick and hot, not too flimsy they would tear easily. I had wanted capris length instead of ankle length but I think I could even pull them up a bit to fit above the top of my mid-calf boots so they won't wear when I dance. Good quality for the price. Nice design."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,"2012 I've bought 3 or 4 of them.  These are the first one I have been using.  The top is a plastic, which is designed to be easily removed from the handlebar.  I have been using this on a couple of them.  The handlebar is not the best design.  I have to keep it in the pocket and on my bag.  I will probably just put it in the pocket and it won't fall off.  I have not tried to use it yet, but I have been using it for a while now.

I have a spare tire, and the handlebar is a bit smaller than the top.  It is a bit difficult to use, and the top does not hold the tire in place"
Electronics_5,0,"Installed easily. Just plugged it into a USB port and Windows 7 recognized it. I should have stopped there. Instead, I installed the driver on the included mini-disk. The driver installed easily, but once it was installed, Skype no longer recognized it. I uninstalled the driver - no joy. I restored my computer to pre-driver installation, no joy. I tried installing the most recent driver from their web site. The installation never finished. I kept getting messages that Windows didn't recognized the publisher, and as soon as the progress bar was full, it started all over again. I tried uninstalling the updated driver and I got messages that something was already running, and it wouldn't uninstall. I have sent Ausdom an email asking for help, but I am returning it if I don't get an immediate, helpful response. My OS is Windows 7, and it is completely up to date.

Right now, it seems the only way to get this software off my system is to completely rebuild it, and I'm not looking forward to doing that."
Kindle_Store_5,0,Larissa Ladd has out done herself here. I was able to connect with the characters in this book. I found myself crying and laughing with the characters and the sex scenes was very intense. I had a hard time putting the book down and would find myself saying just the next page. After the book was read I had to immediately start the next one. I highly recommend reading this series.
Books_5,0,"Yes, I found this book impossible to put down.  I loved it, and think Ozzy is an insane idiot after reading it.  But, I would love to have dinner with he and his wife now, and I never would have thought that before."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"This cute toy has 3 squirrels in a tree stump, all filled toys, of course. My miniature Schnauzer enjoyed ""hunting"" the squirrels, but quickly figured out how to get them out of the various holes. He then proceeded to rip each one's tail off, then rip apart each squirrel, ""de-stuff"" them, and leave stuffing all over the floor. It's a cute toy, but no good for aggressive chewers!"
Kindle_Store_5,1,"Do know this is a spoiler, I thought it was a bit boring, but I was just bored.  I had to read the book to get through the story.  I wanted to go back and look at the other books in this series.  This is a great series for the fans.  I have read the other books in the series and can't wait to see what happens next.  This book has a lot of action and danger.  It's very realistic.  I highly recommend this book.I really enjoyed this book.  I was actually not sure if I liked it or not.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,"Ok so I've seen a few of the other reviews saying that it's too small for my arms.

I had to get a size small and the shoulders are a bit large. The only thing I can say is that I am very pleased with the fit and feel of this shirt. I am very happy with it and it will be a great addition to my collection.I love this gun. It does what it's supposed to do. It's easy to shoot and easy to clean. I've shot about 1,000 rounds in it, and it's actually not bad. It's a bit heavier than I expected, but it's not too heavy. It's a good pistol, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. It's bright and bright. I've had no problems with the battery, and the sight is great. I'm happy with the purchase.Works great on my Trek TDSI bike. I use it for my MTB and other ride-hiking bikes.Works great for my husband.  He loves it.  He does not like it when he rides on the trails.

Electronics_5,0,"Pros: Picture quality is still good, Canon has not lost it's touch after ten years of making Elphs.  The size is awesome, I can place it anywhere I'd like.  With a three inch LCD, who needs a view finder - does anyone still use a view finder?  It offers a lot of scene modes and they are not that difficult to get to, it just takes a little time to get used to the buttons.  The 6.0 megapixel and 3x optical zoom and UA lens is all you need.  This Elph now offers a new ISO 800, which reduces image blur and expands low-light shooting ability.  It's camera solution CD-ROM software has improved a lot, so it's easier to download, edit, and view your pictures.

Cons: It's features are a bit basic but it offers just enough for those point and shot customers.  So if you want a lot of manual features you might want to pay more for another camera.  The LCD might get thumbprints very easily but I have one word for you: invisibleSHIELD.  Amazons might sell one for this camera, if not, do a web search.  It doesn't come with a case or bag; the manual is boring and just like all the others - you may need to buy a book if photography is a hobby for you.  The Function/Set buttons might be too small, but I have small hands so I'm cool with their size.

Conclusion: The Canon PowerShot SD630 is an solid ultracompact camera, with performance and photo quality that more than make up for its few design flaws and it's price. It's a good shooter, and its feature set makes it quite flexible for a camera of its size. That said, it's basically a more expensive version of the PowerShot SD600 with a larger screen and no optical viewfinder."

Movies_and_TV_5,0,"First of all I am a huge Clint Mansell fan and it's no wonder he developed a cult following after this soundtrack. It is amazing and makes the movie that much more impactful. This film just goes to show the power music has over a film. That aside the film itself is a completely sensorial experience. Watching the progression and destruction of these characters you feel as if you yourself are the addict and as the brilliance in shot composition deteriorates so does the characters and audience members along the way. You feel and see what the feel and see and you feel the hunger and desperation for their chosen vice. A beautifully heartbreaking portrayal of addiction and destruction that left me completely engrossed, repelled, and sucked dry of all emotion by the end of the rollercoaster of a film."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"I would have said I love it, but gosh, it's just a pitcher.  On the other hand, it's a better pitcher than I have had in a long time.  Its narrow profile and non-spill lid are great in the refrigerator.  I made concentrated orange juice in it recently and was able to shake the container without spilling a drop; that's not something every pitcher can say.  I was disappointed that it was plastic, but I guess it could be uncomfortably heavy if it weren't.  And the best part of all: it's made in the United States.  Since I'm trying to stay away from any products that will be used for food made in China, that is recommendation enough."
Books_5,0,"Mystery, intrigue, and  real life drama woven around a children's book of magic and murder engaged me every step of the way as  I experienced segregation through eyes of a young, black woman lawyer and a small town.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"Big, sturdy, comfortable.  No clue what the long skinny pocket on the inside would be for, but it doesn't take away from the bag."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,I'm a motorcycle camper.  I have the wide brim and the large brim for my small bike.  I wear a medium and the large.  The light is a nice light and it's bright.  It's not waterproof so it's not very warm and rainy.  The brim is a nice touch as well.  I also like the fact that it folds up so you can use it as a helmet cover.  I think that's important because it allows you to carry around a phone or other items when riding.  The pockets are nice and easy to store.  I'm a huge fan of the long handle bar so I wanted to try out this one.  I'll be ordering another one and shipping out to my destination.  I can't tell you how many times I've worn it.  It's very comfortable and I'm happy with the purchase.Works great on my Trek TDSI bike. I use it for my MTB

The clasp is very sturdy.  I don't have to worry about getting a bit loose because I can keep it on and off and on with the leash.  I love the fact that it's a little bit big for my dog and a little wide for her.  I also like that the clasp is adjustable so I can adjust it without pulling the dog.  It's also easy to adjust the collar so it fits nicely in my hand.  I love the fact that it's lightweight and I don't have to worry about pulling my dog's neck.  I've worn it a little longer than I thought it would be because I didn't want her pulling on it too hard.  She's a very picky eater"
Pet_Supplies_5,1,"I bought this to see if it would work on my two dogs.  They both love it.  The only thing is the plastic is very hard to put on.

Kindle_Store_5,0,"Short, Sexy and Steamy&iexcl;K&iexcl;K&iexcl;K&iexcl;K&iexcl;K.  MY THREE FAVORITE COLORS!

Sean Whitcomb is up for a promotion at his law firm, the test is a dinner for the bosses with his partner to prove his family values. Sean could burn water, but his ex lover Isaiah is a world class chef, so he calls in a favor. Isaiah Waterston has never gotten over the betrayal he felt when Sean left him to pursue his career ten years ago. So when Sean asks him to pretend to be his lover for the weekend and cook a meal for the bosses, Isaiah is hesitant. He makes an assanine comment about topping Sean in exchange for his help, and immediately regrets it when Sean agrees.

Dinner is a huge success as is dessert which consist of Sean laid out naked on the dining room table for Isaiah&iexcl;s tasty treat. The two spend a whirlwind, sex filled weekend together and Sean is more than eager to make his pasts mistakes right. But Isaiah is not buying it and leaves while Sean sleeps and to add salt to the wound, he doesn&iexcl;t return his texts or calls. Can Sean convince Isaiah that he still loves him, he&iexcl;s changed and he&iexcl;d give up everything he&iexcl;s worked ten years to build for another chance with him? Or was one last hoorah all Isaiah was in this for?

I have a new found fascination with interracial M/M novels and novellas, and Dessert did not disappoint! A fast, fun read with some jaw dropping sticky sex on the table that involves bananas and ice cream. The story centers around the present situation with Sean trying to get his lover back, attempting to make up for past mistakes. But there&iexcl;s enough of the past and their individual current lives sprinkled in to add a little depth to the story. If you&iexcl;re looking for a quick read that ends with a cold shower, this is the book for you!

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,Worked very well at restoring my nail gun's performance.  I will buy again when needed.
Kindle_Store_5,0,A peak at the fun side of age play.  This book features several short stories with a variety of themes.  Some of the stories revisit different characters but each story is a complete short story.  In each story you get the sense that everyone is getting exactly what they need and they are better off for it.
Toys_and_Games_5,0,"Granted it is expensive, but it is an excellent figure with a very detailed sculpting.  It does light up and has two different settings of lighting.

I did get a little weird after a few uses.  I could hear my heart rate going up and down"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"The bad:  it is a pain to turn on and off with heavy gloves on.  The app is worthless and is incredibly difficult to get the app to recognize the unit even after it is connected in the bluetooth menu.

The good:  the light defaults to the efficiency mode where the light output changes to the darkness around you.  I use the headlamp mainly for walking around outside a warehouse environment at night.  This is the mode i use 95% of the time so this tool does what i need it to do.  Easy to charge and the light on the side changes color as the battery starts to lose power.

The competition:  i also have a couple streamlight headlamps that take cr123 batteries.  They are variable with a lnob and are very handy for around the farm working on equipment and the like.  They are too bulky to fit in my jacket pocket for work (plus require spare batteries) so they don't really compete well for most applications."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Summary: I bought the light in October. I had it until November, then it broke. I got a replacement in April after a dozen emails or so. The light was pretty nice though.

The light itself is really nice: small, powerful, nice-looking, exactly what I wanted. The accessories are good too. But don't be fooled by the 5 year warranty, unless you are ok with waiting for several months for a replacement.

The light stopped working shortly after the 30 day return period. No worries, I thought, I have 5 years of warranty from Olight, no problems at all. I contacted them, this is what happened.

10/08/2015: I ordered the light from Amazon.
11/16/2015: The light broke. I contacted them. They told me to unscrew the tail cap, disassemble and reassemble it and try again. That did not work.
11/19/2015: They told me that they'd send me a new tail cap.
11/23/2015: I received the new tail cap. That did not work either.
11/25/2015: They assigned me a RMA number and told me to mail the light in (at my expense). I did that.
12/09/2015: They received the light (according to USPS tracking).
01/19/2015: I contacted them asking what was going on. They told me that they mailed it back to the factory and that I should get it back ""soon"".
02/26/2015: I contacted them again, asking what was going on. They told me that they're sorry and that their usual turnaround time is 1-2 months.
03/29/2015: I contacted them again. They replied immediately and told me that the shipping was lost and that the light was discontinued. They offered me a free S30RII Baton, R20 Javelot or S2 Baton. The S30RII and the R20 are both more expensive than the light I originally purchased, and the S2 is about the same. I chose the S2 nevertheless because the S30RII and R20 are significantly larger than the S20R that I originally bought.
About a week later: I received the light."

Toys_and_Games_5,0,"After the problems with the rights for the 1966 Batman TV show were fixed, they finally released an action figure series.  I have been waiting for a figure of this Batman for decades.  Now I finally have one in my hands, and I'm unmistakably pleased (but not in a filthy way, just pleased).

Before everything, as usual, ignore the first production picture and just go straight for the pictures of the figure in the box, or the customer images if you want to know what the figure really looks like.  I'll give you a hint: it looks amazing.  The detail is wonderful.  Not only they perfectly captured the look of the series, but the figure has very good articulation too.  And while it's almost invisible in the pictures, the utility belt has the classic bat emblem too.

Like all the other ones in the series, it comes with a stand and a collectible card, with some artwork of Batman on the front and part of a Batcave wide image in the back, which is completed with the other cards.  The figure is perfectly able to stand on its own, since the feet are large enough and the cape is thankfully made out of light fabric rather than heavy plastic.

Like the other figures, this one has no accesories.  Which is kind of a shame, since Batman had a lot of crazy gadgets in the old series.  I'd have gladly paid double if the figure had come with a small can of Shark-Repelent spray.  No matter.  The figure on its own is a great accomplishment and it's very well crafted, so it's worth 5 stars."

For warmer weather though, I recommend the long sleeve Attack jersey (especially the newer version).  Still the Quest represents a good value.  Fitment is perfect for me.  6'0"", 185lb and Large size fits perfect.  I wish the zipper went all the say down but it still is a great jersey."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"These magnets came neatly packaged in four columns within a flat little box.  The magnets are about the size of a dime, maybe slightly bigger.  One side is plain and the other has a groove in it.  I thought only one side would stick, but it works with either side.  I mainly bought these for my mom who enjoys sticking photos to her fridge.  As a project, I laminated all her photos and then we used these magnets to stick them to the fridge.  These were strong enough to hold the one sheet of laminated photo per magnet, which worked out fine for what we needed.  However, if you were to add say two or three sheets of laminated photo, the magnets don't seem to be as strong.  These are not the strongest magnet, but they are not the weakest either.  They can hold up about three to four sheets of unlaminated photos, just to give you and understanding of their strength.  So, if your papers get too thick, these magnets will lose their magnetism."

I said that the company was great because when I bought the kitchen it was missing the sink. I went to the website to see about ordering a replacement sink. I was afraid that the sink would cost me as much as the entire kitchen cost, but they sent the replacement sink to me for free. I filled out a form and said that the sink had been lost and within a few days a brand new sink was sitting on my front porch. This tells me that the company stands behind their product.

It works well and seems to last for years. I have a Beretta 1270 and it is very light weight. The sights are very well made and easy to sight in.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Started getting into custom woodworking as part of my remodeling business.  First use of this was a small table top.  Setup was easy (RTFM), and worked well.  There is a little variation in the top-to-bottom location of the biscuit grooves but I expected to have to sand the top smooth anyway.  As stated in other reviews, the dust bag is useless.  It clogs up immediately.  At least the dust port shoots the debris a little to the side.  Second project was a 14' x 3' cherry bar top.  Again, required some sanding but came out awesome.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"The cheapest place that I found this was in Bed Bath and Beyond and this was on top of using the 20% coupon. That being said, this is not worth the price that was paid for it. ( hubby paid for it). With tax it came out to $87.09 This is definitely overpriced. I can see spending maybe $50.00 but no more than that. Unfortunately no one is selling it for less than what it cost, unless it's a used item.

This was bought so I could work on my Abs. That being said, this is not the most comfortable piece of equipment to use to do situps. Yes it helps with your neck and not straining it as you come up from doing a ""situp"" but if you have lower back issues, this will not help you. ....If anything , it'll make your lower back much worse. So I wouldn't recommend this if you have back issues.

I've been using this religiously for the past 3 months and only have 15% bodyfat ( female) and I don't see any ABs. My diet is pretty good ( fruits vegetables lean meats etc) but still no sign of any ABs . Unless I'm supposed to have lower bodyfat which I refuse to go lower than 15% to get these ABs then this thing is just not going to work for me. Lower bodyfat is not the answer for me- to many health risks involved with that.
 I'll give it another month and if I see no signs of ABS then this will be going back to the store."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"This is the one flashlight you need for all occasions.  Is it bright?  Eye-popping bright!  5 modes including an SOS signal. Only 6"" long, so can fit in a back pocket OK.  Waterproof, although I haven't tested this feature.  Requires just one battery, which happens to be a size 18650 not found readily in the USA.  (But can be ordered with charger from Amazon.) I am really impressed with these CREE LED flashlights.  Forget about the 9-LED flashlights, and any old-model incandescent flashlights!  They just don't compare at all to these CREE lights. WOW!  Amazon ships directly from China; about 2 weeks for delivery.  Always well packaged.  btw, buy extra batteries."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"My cat has always been a great cat, and after watching the Animal Planet show, My Cat From Hell, I wanted to get some of the toys that Jackson Galaxy uses on the show. My cat does not respond to typical toys with catnip or sound making toys, or lasers. I tried most everything but I noticed how he always seemed to use this or one other toy and the cats just loved them.

I play now more than ever with my kitty kitty and he loves this toy, makes him think he's killed a bird and his confidence is through the roof.

Thanks GoCat for a great product and Jackson Galaxy for a great show. What are you waiting for? Go buy this for your cat and let me know if this review was helpful!"

Electronics_5,0,"I just moved to a new city and was constantly getting lost so I wanted to buy an easy-to-use GPS unit.  I've never owned a GPS before so I can't compare this product to others, but I was able to make good use of this unit within minutes of taking it out of the box.  The touch display and menu navigation are quite user friendly.  It took me a while to figure out the best settings, though. One thing to watch for is whether you are set for it to give the shortest route or the fastest route.  The shortest route will often take you on some pretty bizarre journeys, while fastest route will generally get you onto the major arteries and highways that you'll most likely want to use and remember.  Another thing it took me a while to realize is that you can change the default screen settings to tell you the direction of travel you are going in.  I find that more useful than displaying the time to my destination, which in my experience the device consistently underestimates.  Also not sure why they bothered to have the device tell you your speed, since cars already have speedometers.  Still, a very handy device that I now find almost indispensable."

It is more comfortable and breathable than the standard nylon on my Grand Trunk ultralight. Where Yukon cuts corners is in the cordage and carabiner. They use standard hardware-store type materials. I am please for the price I paid (under $25). But if I was comparing a full price version of this hammock to a full-priced ENO, I'd go for the ENO.

Electronics_5,0,"My first impression when I opened the box that contained this bag was: WOW, GODZILLA.

First, I really didn't care for the metal framing. I thought it made the bag bulky, and unconfortable.  Sure it makes the bag sturdier, but I'm not planning to use my camera backpack as a weapon in a battery assault.  Second, it is not really as spacious as you might think.  The camera compartment is really hard to access since the flap won't stay open on its own when the bag is laid on the ground.  You'll have to hold the flap open, while getting your camera or lense.  Third, the opening for the camera (the way it is designed to open) just makes me cringe.  Even though there is another zipped cover net behind that front flap, I just don't like the fact that anyone walking behind you at the airport can freely open that part of the bag and steal my camera so easily.  In my opinion, the design looks very very cool, it's just very very illogical.

I'm glad to see many people like this bad, and I hope it continues to work well for them.  But this one is not for me.  I'd rather save my money for more expensive lenses, than a more expensive bag and crappy equipment."

I am Legend stars Will Smith as a scientist who has survived a deadly virus that was developed by genetic engineering to kill cancer; instead it has killed off most of mankind.  Smith struggles to live in New York City with his German Shepherd dog surrounded by cannibalistic super strong zombies that only come out at night.  This is a jarring apocalyptic movie that speaks well of Hollywood.  I'm glad that someone in Hollywood is reading Science Fiction.  There's a ton of science fiction books that could be made into good movies.

The players are not the same as other games that have a little strategy involved, so it's a fun game.  But you have to know what to do to get the hang of it, and you have to think about how you're going to do that.  It's a pretty simple game, but it's well made and fun to play.

The goal is to have a group of people who are going to be in a circle with the other players.  Each player has a different kind of magic that they use to bring down the other players.  Some of the magic works better than others, but I think it's a good way to mix things up.  I think the players are going to like it, and they're going to have fun playing this game.

Politics are not seen from Sirius, but through magnifying glasses: dayly and often cynical calculations, fights against political ennemies or so-called friends. Randolph's every days life is a sort of thrilling gambling.

We see how times are changing: at the beginning of the story, upper classes are extremely conservative, prjudiced with birth, wealth, morals, etc and at the end, one of Jennie's niece, an artist, goes to Russia on her own to see what communism is like. Lady Churchill is a fascinating woman! Clever, brave, ambitious, free, quite different from the other women of her time. With such  ""political beasts"" as his father and mother were, we understand why Winston Churchill (remarkably played by Warren Clark) was so outstanding a stateman. Love stories don't lack in the movie; I found particularly moving the love affair between Jennie and the long-suffering Count Kinsky (embodied by the wonderful Jeremy Brett; if you like him, look at ""posthumous Bafta for Jeremy Brett"" on facebook).Though many tragic events occur (Randolph illness and demise, wars...), the dialogues, always brilliant, are often amusing: clever, cynical, sparkling with wit. People of the high society are depicted in a satirical way. Everything is beautiful: houses, costumes, music, actors: Lee Remick, Jeremy Brett...I find 361 minutes were hardly enough."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,"Really looking forward to next time. Great quality and comfortable for a travel mug. I have one in my bathroom and the other in my office. The colors are great. The color is nice and deep. It is a good size for a size 9. I use it for tea and also for a gift. I love the color and the size. I am very happy with this mug. I just wish it came with a little more storage on top. I bought this for a friend who uses to bake cookies for her kids. She loves it, and it is a great size. I ordered these after reading some of the reviews and was surprised at how well they worked. They do work well for my purposes, but the ""raw"" baking is too thin to bake for my family. I wish they were the ones that made the muffins more flaky. I gave them a 4 because I was concerned that they might get a little too thick. I am not sure how long they will last, but I'm sure they will last for a long time. I have not used them yet, but will be putting them in a couple of weeks. They are perfect for my needs, but if they are not made well, I will make them anyway. Very nice quality."

Kindle_Store_5,0,"The storyline was interesting and moved at a nice pace. The characters were developed but you don't see a lot of growth in them. There is the potential for other stories in the series. I will take advantage of that. My major ""negative"" is all of the typos and misspelled words/misused words (pecks instead of pecs for the muscles in the chest). I also had some unanswered questions like how did the bad guys keep finding them. The leap into a relationship between the main characters seemed a bit stark as well. I read this story as part of a collection of books but even as a standalone it is a good story for the price."

Pet_Supplies_5,0,"I have a 10 gallon planted tank with some slow eating fish, so I end up overfeeding them to make sure they all get some sustenance. I had an Eheim 2211 and it worked as hard as it could, but it just wasn't cutting it, and it was an enormous hassle to prime it whenever it needed cleaning - and it needed cleaning constantly, because I was asking it to do too much. I knew I needed a bigger filter and as soon as I realized the Ecco was self-priming, I was sold.

Some key differences between the Ecco and the Classic:
1. The priming pump - huge key. I didn't find the plastic handle to be too flimsy, but I was also gentle with it after having read reviews. It primes so quickly and I don't have to worry about swallowing aquarium water!
2. There's only one nozzle on each tube that controls the flow rate, when on the Classic there was two. For me, this is just easier - less connections mean less possibility for leaks, and I only need one nozzle to control the flow rate anyway.
3. It is so much quieter. Maybe it's because I upgraded the size of the filter so much so it's working less, but I'm amazed that a filter so much bigger is so much quieter. It makes NO noise, it's actually incredible.

So all in all: powerful, quiet, easy to set up and easy to maintain. I'm so happy with it."

Movies_and_TV_5,0,"Some films that you used to love, just don't hold up. And this epic soap is one of them. In the acting department, Mercedes Mc. Cambrige walks away with the film, and Carol Baker is extremely effective. I so wanted to love this film all over again, but it's lost a lot of its magic. The aging makeup is terrible, and James Dean performance suddenly seeems ridiculously mannered. If it had looked a good as it should, it would have helped enormously, but this is a terrible transfer. Sorry to be a spoil sport, but compared to some of the great classics from the '40's, this isn't in the same league. I'm happy that so many people still love it however. For me - I think I've watched it for the last time."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"This is not a 'vine review.' Dollar for dollar I do not know of a higher value than this line of meters. If you want a better one but still high value you can look for some of the Uni-t brand meters for ~$20. One caveat with these, what I call ""Harbor Freight"" meters, is that half of the meter leads are trash. You MUST test the leads. I run 1A through the lead and test the voltage across it with a known good meter. If a lead measures more than .2V at 1A it is unusable. I have seen these leads test as high as .6V at 1A. That is .6 ohm. Many of your readings will be meaningless with leads with that kind of resistance. As for the units themselves, they work quite well. I've only had one fail. The display was quite jumpy for some time. Then the readings started to drift very high before the display just went blank. I avoided these cheap meters for years because I did not think I could get a respectable product for this price, but now this is my go-to meter for when I might leave it behind or lend it out and not get it back. When in doubt go for something with better leads to start with such as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Uni-T-UT30D-Pocket-size-Digital-Multimeter-with-Square-Wave-Generator-50Hz-Sinometer-OEM/dp/B005TLXNPO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Uni-T UT30D Pocket-size Digital Multimeter with Square Wave Generator (50Hz),Sinometer OEM</a>"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"Nice and simple pot. Has six hour timer, however, would like to have a longer delay for the day use. Also, when using the timer, it always resets the final temperature to 190 degree. Would be nice if it can ""remember"" the previous temperature setting. The inner container is coated with floury charcoal, not teflon coating that any other brands offer. It claims to bring out the fine taste of water. To me, at least it looks better than the grey teflon coating. Another feature missing is it does not come with the audible alarm.

Extra spec that I would like to know before ordering:
Power: 700 Watt
Temp setting: 140, 180, 190, 208
No audible alarm for any events.

After all, I am happy with the pot for the price and the build quality. Not sure if I would pay extra $30+ for the fancy features Zojirushi brand offers."

Toys_and_Games_5,0,"I bought this for my 5 year old, and he LOVES it. Let's start with the good:

1. The pictures on the dice are fun and great for a Mario fan.
2. This is a great game to help younger kids who are learning to add and write numbers. It is also good in that it helps teach strategy.
3. Adults can have fun playing as well since we remember this game from when we were young.
4. Everything fits nicely in the question mark box when you are done playing.

The not so good:

1. I had to coat the dice with clear nail polish as a preventative measure to keep the graphics from wearing off (thank you to the reviewer who suggested that)
2. The score cards are really small and for a little kid trying to write numbers, it can be hard to fit the writing into the space allotted. But I have to say that I don't think the score cards are all that much smaller than the yahtzee we used to play. And, as someone else pointed out, the pages are easily scanned and enlarged. The only problem there is that larger papers would not fit so neatly in the box.
3. There is a glaring typo on the scorecard. Not a big deal for adults, but confusing for a five year old.

Overall, for the price, you will get hours of enjoyment from this game. And even if it is not the most durable or well made game, for under 20 dollars, I think it is fine. Especially if you have a Mario fan!"

Kindle_Store_5,1,this is the last book in the series. I was expecting a lot of action and suspense. There was a lot of sexual tension and then the beginning of the book was boring.
Books_5,0,"It contains accurate info but the info it contains is so broad that it skims over most of US History--I guess a textbook is supposed to to that in a general sense, but as a professor I found it lacking and wouldn't have chose this one for my course. I see that it comes with nice online components and is fairly modern but as a student reading it for a self-propelled style course that I took for fun I found that many of the test questions weren't even in this material and I could read it and not know about more than half of what I read. I did appreciate details that weren't in the textbooks of the 1990's like union strikes and monopoly dealings and a greater emphasis on race relations in mining and Native American dealings (more history being revealed) but over all I found the book a bit boring and strangely organized and lacking in depth.-- It jumps too fast post 1900 onward.--It seems to be cramming more history into the same length of textbook these days is their solution to the problem of more and more history being revealed, but I found it more of a problem. 2.5 stars."

Toys_and_Games_5,0,"If you've got a kid who is building cars in the garage they might be okay putting this together, but I'm thinking it's more for adults, both because the game Destiny is not a kid's game, and because there are some very small parts and somewhat complex instructions. At any rate, I would recommend the builder be at least 10-12 years old depending on skill level.

My wife got this and was overjoyed to begin putting it together. She found the instructions a bit frustrating at times, but had it put together in a few days with no help from me, and she's never really done anything like this before so she was surprised that she took to it so well (she really just wanted the finished product but seemed to get really into the building process from my perspective).

There are extra parts that come with the model, and the finished product is mighty cool (though a bit subdued in color, but that's Destiny for you). When you are done you'll have a nice block model to display but I wouldn't recommend ""playing with it"" unless you want to see fragile broken pieces all over your house.

Recommended for Destiny fans who are also builders with moderate skill and enjoy assembling models. Worth the price if building models like this is your thing."

Movies_and_TV_5,0,"Here was something odd when I read the reviews of 1 star ratings - no exclusive content from Toy Story 1 & 2 Blu-Ray Special Editions. I received my package today and check on the content and what I found out - all that was originally released for the Special Editions of Toy Story 1 & 2 Blu-Ray are all there. I am not sure if the comparison was the older DVD Ultimate Edition versions of Toy Story but for the Blu-Ray editions, its all featured.

The packaging is quite nice - cheap cardboard I doubt it. Of course, if handle with care it is durable. Still, while the placement of the disc I felt its best if its in a casing, the foam that holds all ten-disc is something I would rather avoid. The box is rather big and the extra stuff which was stuck on the box is rather annoying.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"It's difficult to open and close the side bags.  It really requires two hands, and when in saddle, that's annoying.  Hopefully we all have horses good enough that you CAN take your hands away from your reins, twist in your saddle, and fiddle with the zipper.  I do, but it's still annoying.

The cantle bag.  I put my oilskin duster (heavy trenchcoat type long jacket, for the men out there who don't know what it is) in the cantle bag, and I could not keep the whole rig right-side up...it kept slipping to one side.  I ended up having to do some serious anchoring to keep it mostly up.  Might be user error, but the next day I just tied my duster on the back of my cantle and left the bag in camp.

It's well-made.  I don't have a complaint about that.  And the pockets are nice & deep.  But I think I'll buy some cheaper ones that are easier to deal with in saddle.
Edit: about 2 years later.  I don't use the cantle bag.  I'm not a hardcore camper or anything like that.  The bags are used every few weekends on a ride (sometimes more).  Still inconvenient to get into in-saddle, but the bags are still in great shape, zippers in great shape. I bumped up from 3 to 4 stars.  I can't quite give it 5 because I can't attest to whether or not the cantle bag is any good."

Movies_and_TV_5,0,"This is not a film for everyone. It sets up a challenging mix of expectations and continually crosses from one genre's conventions to another. It is definitely for film lovers who like something far out of the ordinary. Set in war-time Japan, this story of a doctor literally on the run in his efforts to unravel the mystery of an epidemic of hepatitis among his patients, could be taking place anywhere in this war-torn world today. Resources are in short supply, and everywhere there is violence and fear triggered by the embrace of militarism. The doctor, a heroic figure, is surrounded in this film by the outcasts of society - a prostitute, an opium addict, an escaped prisoner of war. Cheered by recognition from his colleagues in the medical profession that his work is valued and important, he is left with little to make a difference in the world, except his determination to do the best he can.

The sudden shifts of mood in the film, the use of a noisy jazz score, the outbursts of violence, scenes of sexual tension, the heartfelt moments as characters reach out with tenderness to each other, all provide a jumble of conflicting impressions that reflect the chaotic world it mirrors. There's not a single point of view in the film though it ends emphatically with the detonation of an atomic bomb on the horizon, as the doctor and his assistant float in an open boat in the sea (an image that brings to mind the end of Ingmar Bergman's ""Shame""). The film cries out to be viewed again for there is much too much to absorb in a single viewing."

Books_5,0,"This is still the best biographical introduction to the poet Emily Dickinson but it was written in the l970s and tends to include only  material denigrating Susan Dickinson from bystanders from that era. Since Sewall's book, more information about the relationship between Emily and Susan has been uncovered and sheds new light on the subject. In addition, Sewall leaned heavily on material provided by Mabel Loomis Todd about Susan that is - shall we say - one-sided. The book is particularly strong on Emily Dickinson's forbears, family and early years and for this and more I highly recommend it. The chapters on Otis Lord and Samuel Bowles are particularly revealing."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,"When you are trying to find an outlet with a bulb, it's important to know what type of light you have. The LED bulb is very bright, and the bulb is very large.

The bulb is in a large, multi-function light fixture with two large LED outlets.  The bulb is very bright, and it is very large.  It is so bright that it is very bright, and it is very bright that it is very long.

The bulb is about 30 years old, and the light is very dim, which is why I put it in a dimmer.  It is so dim that it is not in use.  It is not bright enough for normal use, and I don't think it would be practical to keep it in a dimmer.

The light fixture is very small, so I wouldn't expect it to be too small, but it is not too small.  I would say that the light fixture is very small, and that it is not too bright.

Pet_Supplies_5,0,"I wanted stainless steel food dishes that sat lower than the standard locking food cups for my ferrets, for use in a Ferret Nation Cage.  By mounting the holder rings upside down, this causes the bowls to wedge into the ring tighter, and thus defeats all ferret efforts to spill the contents. They've never managed it even once, but it's still easy for me to remove the bowls for cleaning and refilling. (Because there isn't a tab on the bottom of these bowls they also sit flat on the counter!) I'm much happier with these proportions and this look. I also have two 16 oz versions in our (cat-sized) travel crate.

Additional Note- The cups that were sent by HorseLovers are Spot brand (by Ethical Products) and are actually all stainless-steel (no black coating on the ring and clamp, which has eventually rusted on other coop cups), and I like the look of this better. They have a thicker, sturdier ring with a looser fit than other coop cups I've bought, so I had to bend the rings a tiny bit toward oval so that the rim of the bowl jams tight against the metal prongs on the back of the clamp. Not a big deal at all, and worth it for stainless steel and a sturdier make. These bowls look like they'll last a long time."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,The one's we received had the green light button on the right not the left as pictured.  Which turns out is exactly what we wanted.  So the picture seems to be mirrored left to right.  Works great though.  If you plan on using several you might want to make a chart of how you set the four dip switches.  When I was testing my handy work I switched the light on and off several times than sat down to rest.  The light then began flashing on and off on its own.  I was confused until my son came upstairs and told me his light was turning on and off.  Only then I realized I set both to the same code accidentally so it was turning on and off both lights.

NOAH'S COMPASS features Liam Pennywell.  In the opening pages, we learn that he has lost his job as a teacher and that he is moving from his apartment into a smaller one to economize.  We discover a few other bits and pieces as well:  he has been married twice (he is divorced from his second wife), and he has three grown daughters plus an older sister.  And then, after an exhausting day of moving and having settled gratefully into bed, Liam wakes up the next day in a hospital, with no memory of how he got there.

This is certainly an interesting premise for a novel.  Liam has not forgotten who HE is; rather, he simply has selective amnesia for the events surrounding the break-in to his home (for he is told that is what happened) and everything immediately thereafter.  Initially, he becomes obsessed with getting these memories back, which leads him on sort of a quest, bringing a new woman unexpectedly into his life, Eunice.  But from here, the book becomes much more haphazard, taking many seemingly random twists and turns--e.g., we learn more about Liam's past, there is some development in the relationship with his daughters, etc.

Ultimately, however, there seems to be no true purpose to this story.  Although I found Liam likable and was actually rooting for him, there just wasn't much to root for by the end of the novel.  So, while the reading of this book was mostly enjoyable, the lack of a satisfying conclusion was disappointing, and with that, I give it a final rating of 3 1/2 stars."

Electronics_5,0,"This purchase was a nice replacement for my older Garmin nuvi 350.  I paid about $120 on sale for this unit and paid nearly $300 for the older nuvi 350.  For starters, the free Lifetime update was very nice.  For my Garmin nuvi 350, I had to purchase the map updates card for about $95.  The screen on this unit is thinner and a little larger.  I was pleased to discover the a/c vent attached mount my daughter bought years ago still works with this Garmin.  I can't yet tell if the Traffic feature is available in my area, at least I haven't been rerouted yet.  I do like that this model tells you roughly what lane to be in for a turn or exit coming up.  I could see where that would be helpful driving in areas like California.  The feature that provides your traveling speed in the lower left is kind of annoying.  I don't know why I would use that if I have a working speedometer and it's not that accurate.  I think I can change that to display the distance to the destination. It boots up faster and does a better job of detecting the satellites. I'm very pleased with it and think it was a terrific value for the money.

I put the older Garmin nuvi 350 in the kids' car.  Utah commonly has addresses like 348 East 500 North. Addresses are indexed from the center of each town.  Once the teenagers figured out that Garmin just wants the 348 for the address and 500 for the street, which then gives you options to choose 500 North or 500 South, they use it whenever driving to someplace new."

For me personally I found his special to be enjoyable, lots of good facts about all the places the tour took place.  I also found all the characters were very funny in all the countries even when the rules were very strict about certain things said on stage.  The DVD does give you a choice of bleep and unbleep so for those like myself and my family we enjoy the uncensored version of all his specials. Which of course fully uncensored specials is five out of seven specials which I now own this one.  I normally do give away any spoilers about DVD'S but those with families, the unbleep version has walter dropping alot of F words on stage during the preformance.  But like said before the special is actually very good if you watch with an open mind and enjoy all the extra's of how they flim it which is what alot of people complain about.

Pet_Supplies_5,0,"We own this bone and went to buy a second one. When I saw it only had 3.5 stars on Amazon, I felt compelled to write a review.

This bone is great. We fill it with peanut butter and freeze it every day for my 40 lb pit bull before he goes in crate.
(1) Very durable. My dog has chewed on it every day for the past 3 weeks and there are no dents in it.
(2) I prefer the glossier material of the Bionic Bone over the more rubbery Kong. The Bionic Bone feels less gross when you pick it up wet.
(3) The Bionic Bone is easy to fill with peanut butter because both sides have holes in them, and it is hollow all the way through. The holes fit the shape of a butter knife well and it is easy to scrape PB off the knife while loading it in.
(4) For the same reasons, it is easier to clean than a Kong (PB tends to get stuck deep in Kongs).
(5) I think that it is better shaped to fit a dog's mouth than the hole of a Kong - my last dog would lose interest in the Kong because he could not reach all PB stuck inside. The Bionic bone is the perfect combination of challenging while not frustrating.

(Sorry Kong - not trying to pick on you.) In conclusion, this is a great product and we are buying a second one."

I received this book in exchange for my honest opinion and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading about life and love.I read this book in one sitting, and immediately fell in love with it.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"I really wanted to like these as I read so many good reviews, and they look great when worn. First off, I have deeper eye sockets and always have had challenges finding goggles that don't leak.

After seating the goggle and tightening down with a firm, yet comfortable tension, these goggles didn't leak for about 500 yards. Then a small leak started, which i think was from the outer edge. Fortunately, the water didn't funnel directly into my eye, however it was a distraction. After pausing my swim, drying my face and goggles, and tightening things down even more, the goggle didn't leak for another 100-200 yards then water came in again. I tried several other times to reposition and tighten things, but this model just wouldn't work for me. Side note, I ended up with large raccoon eyes and a major headache from tightening things down for at least 24hrs after my swim. I probably should have conceded sooner :(

I hate giving a low rating as this product is very good quality for the price, and look fantastic, however it just isn't for all swimmers."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"I bought this to replace a smaller pack. It's worked out well for me. I have carried upwards of 80+ lbs. with no problems several miles. Not quite sure about the two loops on the lower back area. Seems useless for me. I would wish it had a few more pockets on the outer sides. Anyways its a great pack. Highly recommend. Edited. My Son and I took a 40 mile 10 day trip up into the Cascades near Mt. Hood in the National Forest. My back weight was nearly 65-70 lbs. Carried 30 meals, 3 man tent, 6 liters of water, stove & 3 30oz fuel bottles, water filter, shorts, hand gun plus 1 box of ammo, 2 shirts, 5 lbs dog food. Let me tell ya this pack was very heavy. But we had no choice we had no car or out side assistance. Pretty much basic stuff. The pack preformed very well. At time when I was dead tired I'd drop it to the ground. I do wished it had more outside pockets. The sleeping bag I carried is a 5 lbs 30 bag. So a bit more space than a down bag. (Which Im buying soon. )
Anyhow the backpack stood up to the 10 day trip and it's ready now for an other trip that I'm planning. I am considering buying the Ospray 105 only because I'm a big guy and it would fit me better."

Toys_and_Games_5,0,"Kids love this toy and it spans quite a few ages. It spurs their imagination and creativity to pretend they are in a store. When a couple of kids are together one or two can shop and one can take turns being cashier. They love scanning random things and hearing the voice say a price. They love getting on the microphone saying, ""Clean up in aisle 7"" type stuff. My sister who has oodles of toys for visiting nieces and nephews had this for years and I have watched kid after kid happily using this toy. Hers is still working and it has through rough toddlers and kid tussles etc. I just bought this one from Amazon for my grand-daughter. It looks exactly the same, but I will try and report back if it has any problems or if it seems they have cheapened the design. Several weeks and so far so good."

I'm a bit disappointed. This is a very good book. I'm looking forward to the next one. I hope it goes on to be more. I just finished reading this book and I am so happy to be back with it again. I am very happy to be back with it again. I am not sure how I feel about this book but it's a real good read. I love the characters. It's a fun story and I would definitely recommend it to my friends. I can't wait to see what happens with the other characters."
Movies_and_TV_5,0,"Should really have been called ""The Men from UNCLE before they became the Men from UNCLE"" because this is actually the run-up period to the creation of the United Network Command for Law and Enforcement. So if you're hoping to see the UNCLE HQ and hear ""Open Channel D"" then you are going to be slightly disappointed.

Nevertheless this is a great film. The story is far superior to any James Bond movie and the characters are necessarily brought up-to-date (I saw an original TV episode and it was stunningly cheesy and out-dated). Some of the photography is highly innovative and there is a considerable injection of humor throughout the movie. Overall it had the right feel for a Man from UNCLE film without being ridiculously trapped in the past.

Cavill nails Napoleon Solo but Arnie Hammer struggles to reinvent the original Kuryakin character. Overall I'm okay with his performance but really there is no substitute for David McCallum. Truth is, his assignment was unenviable.

I'm not sure why this film didn't soar in the cinema - maybe too few of the younger generation are familiar with this long dead TV series. Anyhow, do yourself a favor and give it a chance. Especially if you like James Bond movies."
Electronics_5,0,"I mounted several projectors before, and this mount is one of the poorest design.

First, documentation was almost non-existent. You will need to ""fill in the gap"", to figure out where all the screws go.  Most of the time, I had to improvise and even use some nuts and bolts from my own tool kit.

Second, the mount did not fit Optoma HD131Xe.  I played around with different configuration options, and finally had to bend one of the arms, and put some holes in another, just to make it fit.

Third, the sliding arm design is very poor.  There is very limited range of adjustment (15 degrees according to the manual, but more like 10 degrees), and adjustment screws are very hard to reach.  Most of the good design mounts have full 360 horizontal turning ability, but not this one.  Once you installed it, you are done."

But, I still had to pay the plumber twice.

Worked great for about 6 months, then the sprayer started leaking. My bad for not contacting the company. It continues to leak, particularly if water is on high.

The torso is made of a different material than the original figure, and the figure's head is made of a different material, but the legs are made of a different material.

As a 56 year old woman, I can say that the author really ""gets it"" about keeping the passion in your life way past what many people think you can.  It's a story that really appeals to women as it addresses the challenges of life, losing someone you truly adored, and then managing somehow to find somebody else who can fill the void in your life that you never thought could ever be found again.  In fact, if it was not for the light BDSM elements in the story, this could actually be made into a movie for Lifetime, Hallmark, or Up."

These phones fit on top of your ears using foam covers. The fit is not too tight

these phones so maybe someone else can comment on their ability to stay on
the head during a workout.

A nice convenience is that the ear phone cups rotate flat if you would like to
compact them or hang them around your neck when not in use.

For the money, less than $12.00, they are adequate and if you walk on them or
the dog eats them not much of a loss.

Not a bad replacement for ear-buds if you prefer a descent set of portable
headphones. On notice: a lot of ear-buds will actually reduce exterior noise better
than these cups."

Electronics_5,0,I am ashamed to say that I was enough of a sucker to have gone through three of these cassette adapters. The sound quality was terrible and for some odd reason the cables split exposing frayed wiring that eventually breaks and severing the connections also the tape mechanisms constantly make clicking and snapping sounds while in operation. I do not recommend this product to anyone. Try Sony's adapters.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"If you're getting this thing to act as your primary screwdriver, you're going to be disappointed. It's not supposed to be an everyday replacement for your screwdriver. instead, this is the tool you chuck in your bag or car console so that, in a pinch, you have a screwdriver slightly better than on a multi-tool. The option of precision/normal in phillips/flathead is nice, too. Again, though, keep in mind that this is a pocket screwdriver, so if you subject it to frequent use and abuse, it's going to act like what it is: a relatively inexpensive pocket tool."

Books_5,1,"Cowell delivers a narrative of what happens when the U.S. becomes involved in the war and the role that the West played in it.  The reader is introduced to a strong and determined young man who is not in the military, but is an American soldier who has served in the field and a woman who is a native of Afghanistan.  The story is told from the point of view of a young soldier who has spent his entire life on the battlefield and has seen much of the horror and devastation of war.

The book is well written and provides insight into the role of the West in the war.  Powell's book is a good read and I recommend it.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it is not a riveting story.  I will be re-reading the book several times.This is a book about a teen in the 60's.  When he was 16 he went to a local library to read books by other people.  He went and bought this book.  He was very disappointed with the price of it.  I was able to get it for $20 and it was a great value.  I loved it.  I have read a lot of books on this subject and I have read a lot of books about it.  This is a good book.  The story is told from the point of view of a boy who is very young. "

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"I bought this Women's V Neck Short Sleeve Lace Mesh Inset Open Back Casual Plus Size Top in caramel, I thought on the screen it was a lovely neutral color and I still think so after receiving it. I will say right away that I am plus sized and these run small. I bought a 3X and unfortunately its like its painted on me instead of a little loose. Knowing that though, if you're thinner than me, or a different shape (I am an apple) I would buy at least a size up. I will say though I tested this just like any other clothing I get to test and review in exchange for my honest unbiased feedback. I don't hand wash. Anything. Ever. Thats what washing machines are for. Mine has a hand wash setting, so I decided to try putting the shirt in on that setting. I have used it for many hand wash only items before with no problem. Same thing this time. The shirt came through the wash and tumble dry on medium heat just fine. I would always recommend following the label instructions, but if you're lazy like me and want to try a machine, youd probably be ok. Even though I won't be wearing this shirt until I hopefully lose some weight, I do think its a lovely fabric, color and style. I found it very soft and quite comfy, albeit too tight for my liking. That being said, if you're into form fitting tops, you might want to wear this, I just prefer looser, more flowy tops.

I had to replace a couple of these, and the first one I used was just a little hard to get the lid off. I placed it on the bottom of the container, and it's pretty much a metal sink, which is great for storing things like paper towels, but I just didn't want to put the lid on.

Toys_and_Games_5,0,This float is big...in a good way. It's very sturdy and holds my 4 1/2 month old son very well. He likes the toys that are included but I stick the foam ones on the side of the shower wall during his bath to help entertain him. They also help me to teach him a few primary colors. The canopy is adjustable and keeps the sun off of him nicely. Well worth the money.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,This latch powerlifting belt is 10mm thick. It's huge and very supportive for those heavy squats or dead lifts. I do recommend this if you are pushing some high weight. The latch buckle is pretty easy to adjust. You do need a screwdriver to set the amount of pressure you want. I'm a 32 to 33 waist but I have it on the lowest tightest openings. I may need to drill a hole or two otherwise great products I do recommend for powerlifting. I did receive this at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
Electronics_5,0,"I have Comcast 75Mb service.  I had a very old zoom 5341J (8x4) running until it died.  I put back in my even older Zoom 5341 (4x4) modem while I looked for a replacement.  I tried the Arris SB6141 (8x4) which worked well until it died.  So I decided to try something else and liked the idea of this 16x4 model.  However, once I replaced the Zoom, it would only achieve 55 Mb/s download.  I tried multiple power resets, but even though it bonded with 16 download channels I would peak about 55 Mb/s.  I put the very old Zoom (4x4) back in and it went back to 82Mb/s,  There are no configurable parameters.  I had expected at least the same performance and possibly better than the very old Zoom."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,I have an old yellow one and it was very thin but it was perfect for the baby and we loved it.  The plastic parts are very sturdy and we use them often.  We bought this one in the hopes it would be a better deal.  It is very sturdy and the rubber parts are great for holding the baby and the baby is very soft.  It has a very nice height for the baby and it is pretty strong.  I like that the rubber parts are not too firm to get into the mold.  I use this mold for our first baby shower and it is super soft and comfortable.  I do wish it had a little more of a grip on the mold.  It is a bit flimsy but for the price it is a good deal.  I was able to find some sheets that are made of

Movies_and_TV_5,0,"I haven't read the well regarded comic book (er, sorry, graphic novel), but this movie is terribly dull. The idea of taking well known characters from the Victorian Era's popular literature (Allan Quartermain, Captain Nemo, Tom Sawyer, Dr. Jekyll, Dorian Gray, The Invisible Man from the novel by H.G. Wells, Mina Harker from Dracula) and rethink them as superheroes sounds odd but interesting. And if such endeavor would make some young people read the original books, one can certainly sympathize with that. But this film is dull. The action scenes are uninspired. And one wonders if the filmmakers even read the original material: here Dorian Gray has more lives than Terminator, Verne's Captain Nemo looks more like Sandokan, Jekyll is inspired more by the incredible Hulk than by the character of Robert Louis Stevenson's novel, Tom Saywer is a hothead cowboy rather than Mark Twain's country boy, etc. There are fine actors here (Sean Connery, for one) but they look embarrassed here, as well as they should be. Even the retro Victorian look seems uninspired. Overall, a huge disappointment."

I just wish it was for a full 7 days to make it easier for me to remember to fill it. The numbers are at the bottom of each 1 cup section but black on black is hard for me to see. I've had it for almost a month and my cat was eating out of it in a few minutes the first day, the 2nd day almost no hesitation and after than, she sits quietly by it up to an hour before the timer opens the compartment and as soon as it starts to shift, she's eating. I really like the recording feature. I think it really helped the first 2 days but she doesn't need it anymore."

On the positive side, the fabric and quality was beautiful."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,Hatchet arrived covered in some oily substance that smelled and left black marks on hands. Perhaps like curing a cast iron pan however this isn't iron. Looked used. Heavy and fits nicely in hand and will be used for son and husband as they backpack and camp.
Pet_Supplies_5,0,This is a terrible product. It doesn't sit up on its own. I'm so mad at myself for even buying this but all the previous reviews made it look so great. Total waste of money. My 10 lb min pin can barely hide out in it!!
Movies_and_TV_5,0,"I love this film and rented it from Netflix on a few occasions.  Would LOVE to purchase the DVD from Amazon, but with a $150.00 - $200.00 price tag, FORGET IT!  This is a film screaming for a remastered Blu-Ray release...at a reasonable price."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"Beagle doesn't like when it goes over her head but it is comfy and doesn't rub her raw anywhere. Other harnesses she was always trying to wiggle out of. When she takes off after a smell and reaches the end of the leash, the harness protects her from being jerked back."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,Started using these at 12 months with my girl who is petite and still using them. A good purchase.
Kindle_Store_5,1,This book has a few cliffhangers.  The first one is that the author does not include a full length story.  The second one is that there is a great deal of sex.  I found myself in tears in the beginning.  This book is still very good.  I recommend it to anyone who enjoys erotica.I loved this book. It has great characters and plot. This book has a lot of sex. It was hot and steamy. I can't wait to read more from this author.I liked this book.  I was just a
Toys_and_Games_5,1,"My son loves this toy! We have had it for a few months now and it's been just fine. The only thing I wish was a bit more plastic, would have been better for it to be more durable. I would have liked to have made a better product. I love that it's a toy that helps with learning and attention span. I wish I could have bought a different set of toys to keep it fresh."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"Love it! .......... sooooo comfortable you can't go wrong with one of these ..... washed up great as well.  I used warm wash and med dry.  Nice length, even for me  (I am 5'10"")."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"These are great!  Strong, multiple sizes, very high quality.  I have bought cheap-o brands that break easily.  These seem pretty much unbreakable.  Excellent product."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,1,"Appears to be good and looks good, but the fabric is a little tighter than I expected."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,Bought this for the girls. They love it. It is very comfortable and they have a lot of room for two.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"I recently lost my Contigo mug like this and started using a random back-up mug I already had laying around the kitchen. After a few days, I noticed that I'd finished my coffee hours earlier than usual every single morning with the back-up mug. Normally I sip on my coffee until it's nearly lunchtime, but now I was finishing it on my morning commute.

The next morning I was thinking about this and realized exactly what the cause was: My Contigo mug kept my coffee so hot that I could not take big gulps of it and it took me until 11 am to get through it. The back-up mug cooled so quickly that I was gulping my coffee by the time I got in the car.

After less than a week I ordered a new Contigo and I will be a customer for life now.

This mug will keep your coffee pipingly, tongue-burningly hot for hours when sealed. Like others have said, I actually leave the lid off for a couple of minutes after I pour and blow on it to bring it down to a drinkable temperature because I know once I seal the lid it's staying that hot. The more of the coffee you drink the more it will start to lose its heat (because you're replacing hot coffee with room-temperature air with every sip, which is cooling the remaining coffee). But the cooling happens slowly enough that the only time the liquid inside of it really gets *cold* is when the cup is less than half full and the snap lid is open, which is letting a lot of air circulate inside the cup. If you leave it full, it will stay *hot*--not warm--for 7 hours."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,Runs small. I'm normally a medium and I had to buy XL to fit perfect. Comfortable shirt and does the job. Love the color too.

Books_5,0,"I recieved this book from my local library.
This book is worth more than 5 stars. Its absolutely amazing. This is my first book by this author. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The depth of this story is absolutely brilliant. I stayed up late just to finish this story. Its so sad what you go through with a devastating tornado. This is the first story I read about the after effects of the tornado. The way this author wrote about the tornado and the after effects was amazing.
The character breakdown
Jersey Cameron goes through alot in this story. She is such a brave person, at times you don't know how she overcomes some of what she does. But she does overcome alot and it captivates you. Jersey Cameron is brave and sweet, but she can be so mean when she needs to be. I loved her character.
Jersey's mom and Marin. Jersey's mom claims to be something she isnt. She seems brave but she isn't at all. I didn't really like her character. Marin is Jerseys half sister and she is the sweetest cutest little girl. I enjoyed her character.
Ronnie after the tornado was just a waste he was not brave at all. He didn't do as well as Jersey did and I just didn't like him.
Jersey didn't really know her mom like she thought. But what she finds out. It takes so much for her to believe it.
Everybody should read this story. It opens your eyes to what could really happen in a tornado. Its emotional on every level. Very Powerful. Riveting. Just absolutely AMAZING. I loved every second of this book.
#mustread  #captivating  #wonderfulandamazing"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,1,My last pair lasted several years. The quality is good but the fit is just a little tight.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"This is based on the Iain Sinclair credit card knife. These ones however are generic and have no brands imprinted on them. I do not have an authentic Iain Sinclair knife to compare these with, so I'll go stag with this review and give you the raw details and ONLY this product.

I ordered these on Amazon from China in a bulk package of 4 for about $5 as favors for friends. Now in its packaging, already I notice the plastic parts wobble... because they are extremely thing. The cards measures 5 3/4 inch by a little more than 2 inches. They're easy to figure out how the use despite the fact that they do not come with instructions. There is a safety wheel that needs to be turned with a fingernail so that the blade can pop out. After you fold the blade back along the cutout, the other two flaps of the card fold together to form the handle. They will not pop out unless you force them apart.

The knife itself is about half a millimeter (mm) thick. This would not be applicable for any defense situation, This would however come handy with opening letters and tapes  (but not bubble wrapped packages or cardboard boxing). The entire knife is not as a solid as an actual switchblade or letter opener and flops around quite flimsily.

The folded card will fit in most wallets where credit/gift/debit/reward cards usually go. The card is lightweight and will take no more than 6-7 seconds for an average person to assemble.

Great novelty item, but not very applicable. I may buy the original Iain Sinclair model to compare, but if there are for your collection or as favors to friends, you might as well go for it, for the great price these are offered."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,1,The PERFECT shoe!!!! I've been wearing these shoes for about a month now and they have held up just fine. I had to replace a pair of shoes that had been worn a lot and that had broken in. I have a pair of size 9. 5 and they are very comfortable. They are not very long and I have worn them over and over with a pair of shoes. I would recommend them to anyone looking for an athletic shoe. I bought these for my boyfriend and he loves them.
Toys_and_Games_5,1,This is the perfect case for an easy to carry and carry toy. My son loves this one.I bought this for my son for Christmas and he absolutely loves it. The only thing that I do like about it is the size of the hat. My son is 4 and loves to play with it. He's also the most active
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,These lamps are very cool!  I love the fact that I can turn my light on and off. The brightness is amazing. I can get the light to be brighter or darker than it is. It will be a perfect gift for my mom or dad.
Kindle_Store_5,0,"How do I describe this 2nd book in the Steel series? Well, for starters, it continues the ride you began in book 1. And by ride, I mean fast-paced-edge of seat danger-where did that hit come from type of ride. You thought you knew who the players were in book 1. You thought you knew just how much Mic could take. You could guess what was gong to happen with Mic and Jordan. Ha! J.B. fools you completely. The book takes you where you didn't expect to go. You learn more about Mic. And just when you think things are going to heat up, a different sort of excitement happens and you are left wondering now what? I love the introduction of Mic's Aunt and the chemistry between her and Jackson. AS for Rook, well he's not Phillips but I think he is what Steel needs now. I cannot wait for book 3!"

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,"As a former Marine I know what I want to do.

The only reason I ordered this is because I had a bad run.  My running shoes are so great and I have to wear them all the time.  I was thinking about going with this as it would be a little more comfortable.

I did get a free item for review.

I will update if I find a better solution to the issue.  It may take a while to figure out how it works out, but I'm sure it will be a very helpful tool."
Books_5,0,"I initially found the book slow moving,hard to get into, and actually stopped reading it a couple of times. But, I picked it up again and am delighted that I did. It is the moving story of the life of a soldier, but, more importantly, the life of a man. Helprin's lyrical style, similes and metaphors explore the joys, sorrows, absurdities, loves, victories and defeats of Alessandro Giullani's life while making the reading a pleasure."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"This is a replacement for my last Cuisinart 12 cup coffee maker (which was probably 6 plus years old); it is almost identical; the only upgrade is this one comes with a little metal coffee filter; you have the option of removing this metal cone and using the paper filters.  From what I have read, I have decided to just use the paper ones as  they remove more sediment and oil.  I like a mild, bitter free coffee (so I use a Chemex whenever I have time--BEST COFFEE MAKER IN THE WORLD IN MY OPINION--but not a good unit when you are going to work or in a hurry--see my review on it).  Anyway, when time is short, this coffee maker is simple to operate, has a small clock (that you can't see very well as it is very small and inconspicuous); the machine is programmable as advertised.  The unit has a small charcoal filter that is easily accessible (it's at the end of the plastic piece that fits in the top left corner of the machine where you put the water in), and it is very easy to change (the plastic double piece just pops open and then you can remove the old filter).  The controls are pretty much the same as my old unit except there is now an off/on switch (my old one you just moved the dial to brew, and  presto it started working).  This unit (like the old one) has a 1 to 4 cup brewing option.  I guess what I am saying is if it isn't broke don't fix  it (or if you have a good product don't make a lot of changes to it--it should last well if you take care of it--like most things in life).  I think it is the best electrical unit on the market for the money."
Toys_and_Games_5,0,"Lower end toys, but they are what I ordered. Excellent for the price"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,"We live rural and use a lot of electricity and these bulbs are great for that. I just purchased a pair of these and am happy with the results.I bought this to replace a broken saw.  It is a good value, and it works as advertised.  I would definitely buy again.  I have a few of these in the house and they are a great deal.  I just installed them with the original saw and they are very smooth and accurate.  I have not used them yet, but I am sure they will last a very long time. "
Pet_Supplies_5,1,"I bought two soft sided collars and they work great.  I also have a large one.  The adjustable collar is nice, but the adjustable collars are not adjustable enough to reach the dog.  It's a little difficult to use them as I don't know how long they last.  I have a German Shepherd and a medium-size dog.  I like the adjustable collars because they don't hurt the dog and they don't have a leash on the collar.  I also like that the collar is adjustable, but the collar is not adjustable enough to reach the dog.  I have a medium-sized"
Pet_Supplies_5,1,"This box was purchased for a puppy and the materials are good.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very small, and the cover is very large.

It will probably be a little bigger for her, but it will hold up"

The top is a nice, solid surface, but if you don't have a cat or dog, it's not a very strong surface.  This one is still very sturdy.  I have 2 cats and I like the design of the top and it is a nice design.  I just wish there was a collar attachment for the two cats.  It's very easy to put on and take off, but the collar is too small for my dog.  I just wish there was a collar that would attach the top to the dog's collar.  It would be nice if I"

Toys_and_Games_5,0,"This gym is great, my son started using it when he was around 6 weeks old, and now he is 8 months and still loves to play with the toys. It was very helpful as we could put him on the mat and have our dinner. He even learned to turn over to his back at the age of 2.5 months by holding the mat.
The music is very good - we don't get tired of it for months."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,1,"This watch is my second pair of the same watch. I will keep this one in my collection.I bought this for my son, who lives in the North Dakota area.  He is 5'3"" and 175lbs, which was perfect for him.  He wears a size 7 and a size 8.  I ordered a size 11 and the fit is perfect.  He will be wearing this watch all winter long.  The only negative I have is that it is very cheap material.  I am hoping the price will be higher, since he is a size 7.  Otherwise, it's a great watch.  The only negative is that it is very heavy and you cannot wear it with jeans.  However, it is not thin and thin enough to cover his entire body.  It is light, but very cool.  I have a size 8 and ordered a size 10.  I am hoping the price will go up a bit, since the band is a bit small and the band is a bit short.

UPDATE:  I ordered the large and it fit perfectly"
Movies_and_TV_5,1,"Good movie. Not the best, but it was very good.

The story is a bit"
Books_5,1,"I rated Partials a 4, but I thought it was a 4.

The first one was a little too long and I liked it a bit more than the first one.  The story was well told and the ending was a bit predictable.  I don't know how I would rate a book without a lot of twists and turns.  I think I would rate it a 3 if I were reading it in a different time frame.  I don't know if I'd rate it a 4 or 5.

Overall, I loved this one.  I just didn't get it right and maybe it is because I didn't like the ending.  It did leave me wanting more.I'm a huge fan of the YA series and have read them all.  I was a little disappointed in the ending.  I was hoping for a good story and I was disappointed.  I enjoyed the book but I didn't get to know the characters well enough to really see how they fit into the"

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,"This band definitely feels strong; it has the wide, comfortable fit of a wristband. I'm very pleased with the quality of the fit. The band is very tight and it is made of high quality material. It does not stretch or tighten. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a band that is comfortable for their wrist. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a band that is not comfortable for their wrist.These are great for putting on some goggles. They're not super tight, but they don't fog up the face. I'm very happy with them. I'm 5'11"" and weigh 165 lbs. They're a little too big for me to wear on my face, but they're well worth the money.Great product, great service. I've had no problems with this product.Easy to install, great price.  My only complaint is that the rubber on the handle is a little weird.  I thought it was good, but it isn't.  So, I just order another one.I'm always looking for a lightweight shirt to wear when riding my bike. This one is exactly what I was looking for. It is very comfortable and fits perfectly in my bike. The only thing I'm not happy about is that it's a little too large. It will eventually get to my small size and I'll probably have to buy another one.I received this item as a gift for my wife.

Movies_and_TV_5,0,"This movie was much better that I was expecting. It had some great one-liners and is the 1st best comedy of the year. Ice Cube and Kevin Hart were perfectly matched and played to each other's comedy style very well. Hart plays Ben Barber, a jumpy security guard who plays video games and in love with James's sister, Angela. James hates Ben and wants nothing to do with him. When Ben is accepted at the police academy, James decides to take him on a 'ride along' to show him what the police world is really like. Throughout the day, James gives Ben silly assignments that no one else wants. It all leads up to a confrontation with Omar, the main villain that James is obsessed with catching. If you want a good comedy, I highly recommend RIDE ALONG!!!"

Books_5,1,Very interesting book. I recommend it highly. I've read all of her books and just can't get enough of her stories. This is the first of the three I've read by this author and she has a way of putting it down. I recommend it highly. I love a book that starts with the most beautiful idea and then lets you think about how you could accomplish it. This book is a must read for any creative mind. I would recommend it to anyone who is into music. I enjoyed this book. It was a little confusing at times but it was well written. I really enjoyed the characters and the story. It was interesting to see how the two different families formed. I loved how the family was represented and how it was connected. I enjoyed the history of the family and how it was different. I liked how the author used the example of a priest from a different family to explain the family. I enjoyed the stories and the characters and the story. I liked the historical background of the family and how it was connected. It was a great read. I was very impressed with this book. It was very different from the other books I have read about the history of the old West and the American Revolution. I thought the characters were interesting and well-drawn.
Toys_and_Games_5,0,"I was so excited to see this Toy back on the market. This adorable huggable breathing Golden Retriever Puppy was very popular back 6 or 7 years ago. It was a gift to me from my husband, but my little 3 year old Grand-daughter was fascinated with just
watching it lay there and breathe like a real sleeping puppy. She would just stand and watch it for hours. Over the years, she
has loved this little puppy named, ""Honey"". During all her visits over the years, it was one of her favorites. It finally stopped working,
and we could not fix it. My Grand-daughter said if I ever found another one, she would really love to have it for her own.
I found it here on Amazon. The exact one that she wanted.
I just gave this Puppy to her on her 10th birthday, and she is thrilled. She lost her real dog, so this sleeps on her bed with her
at night. It came in it's own adorable Puppy bed, with a brush, a tagged collar, and real adoption papers to fill out. She is thrilled.
It is very well made and very real looking. I would say any child over 3 or 4 would love to have this Huggable Breathing Puppy to sleep on their bed with them at night. This made one little girl very happy."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Testing this as a free product from the Amazon Vine program.
Space age looking, and heavier than most standard claw hammers, but easy to use and swing with less shock than a wooden or straight plastic handled hammer.
Like others I have noticed some nicks and scratches after very little uses so suggest the steel is a little softer than it should be maybe.
At nearly $50 this hammer is almost 3 times more expensive than the Estwing steel shaft 16 oz claw hammer, over 2.5 times as much as the excellent Stanley 51-163 16-Ounce FatMax Xtreme AntiVibe Rip Claw Nailing Hammer, and around six times more than a standard hickory handled or fibreglass Stanley. Aside from the magnetic nail channel (great feature) I don't see a huge amount to justify the price. It does have a lifetime warranty, but then again it should at the price. I was generous and gave it 4 stars."

Movies_and_TV_5,0,"I had heard about 24 for a long time before ever seeing it.  I finally saw an episode a few weeks ago and thought it was quite good.  I ended up deciding to watch the first season.

It was certainly a highly entertaining show with no end to the action.  It contains murder, espionage, terrorism, traitors, kidnapping and a presidential assassination plot.  And that is all in one day.

The concept of the show is that each episode represents one hour of a day in real time.  The hero, federal anti terrorist agent Jack Bauer, encounters more action in two hours than any 50 average people do in their entire lives.

Although some of the events are certainly implausible in the time frames allotted, it is great entertainment.  Although I am not much of a TV watcher, I may just become one for this show.  I recommend it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,Works perfectly.  Easy to put in your art and hang.
Pet_Supplies_5,1,"This works well enough but it takes a long time to set up. My dog loves this treat. I bought this for a friend who has a small dog and she had a very sensitive stomach. She had severe diarrhea in the past, and had been eating her food for a few months. This food is a good product and I'm very happy with it. It has great ingredients and my dogs love it. I used this for two years and it has held up very well."

Movies_and_TV_5,1,"It's clear that Mapes et al. (who are in charge of the film) have been experimenting with a lot of new ideas. The idea that the basic idea of a great detective is that it's a person who will solve cases, that it's going to be some sort of meta-story, that it's going to be a movie about a man who goes out on a crime spree, and that there's some kind of connection to the man. But that's not what the film is about.

I would not be surprised if it came with some kind of ""dug"" that would allow it to ""handle"" the suction.  However, it is a little difficult to use because the suction is not strong enough to grip the plastic part with a good grip.  The suction is also very strong, so I would not expect it to hold"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"The day after I ordered this my husband came home with a DC40 Animal which he got at a warehouse store for way less.  Since it was a gift and included an upholstery brush I kept it and returned the one I ordered which, as an aside, was super easy.

I love the Dyson.  While it's kind of heavy and the ball thing is awkward the cleaning power is phenomenal. Don't have carpeting but the area rugs look almost new.
Am kind of partial to bagless vacs...gives me an instant return on my efforts by seeing what I've actually picked up and this canister is easy to empty.

The cord is plenty long as is the hose, great for my high ceilinged rooms.

The time to assemble the machine was approx 10 minutes, so easy I wondered if I had done it right.  Have read complaints about the instruction manual but I found it as adequate as I needed it to be.

Another thing which convinced me that the Dyson cleans better than any machine I've owned is that after a weekly vac I can use my Roomba and the little robot doesn't constantly bog down and need cleaning.  It can complete an entire cleaning cycle without begging for help.  In a household with 2 dogs and a cat that is something.

Yeah, I love my Dyson and so does the iRobot. We're both happy now."

The first time i only got the handle. Second time i only got the bender. both times the same sticker with the model number was on both. They needed to have Part 1 of 2 and part 2 of 2 on the stickers.  If you order this you may only get a handle, or you may only get a bender.  You should be getting both parts for this price."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,I inherited a 6 gallon compressor and a couple of air houses from a family member.  I'm guessing they are about 10 year old.  All of the fittings were leaking air pretty badly to the point where the compressor was almost always running.  I replaced the fittings with these and couldn't be happier.

The fit is perfect and the fit is true to size.I like it. It fits great. I'm a size 10.5 and this is the perfect size. I bought a medium because I wanted it to be a little more loose around the top of my foot but I'm sure it will loosen up if you go up a size.This is a great wallet for the price. It's very light weight, and the wallet is very well made"
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"I actually ordered the Litter Genie by mistake and let it sit for months. Now that I am using it I find the whole process annoying. This review should focus on the refills. It would be so much better if they came pre-sized with strongly sealed bottoms, perforated to separate and start a new one so all we have to do is push the refill down into the chamber. The whole size guessing, having to try to balloon out the plastic in the bottom to guess what length to cut then tie a secure knot in the bottom and hope you have performed all steps well enough so no blow-outs upon removal is vexing. The built in cutter works smoothly so scissors aren't needed. I am refraining from commenting on the entire device but can't separate  the two that easily. It might be better if the refills were better designed. I have a large cat with large urine clumps. They don't fit in the scoop and are ~too large to dump in the top. I use hard clumping scoopable litter. I wonder how messy it must be with old-fashioned clay, pine pellets or other media? I get tired of used litter scattering about during transfer, on the floor, the handles, the lip of the entrance and such.
I plan to use up the refills and donate this thing because my old large efficient sturdy scoop+ brown paper lunch bags collected into repurposed bags works better and is cheaper.
How about odor? I haven't quizzed friends but should. I am concerned because my cat has stopped defecating in his box since this was added and it is the ONLY change. Is it odor or something else that is distressing him? 40+ yrs as a cat owner and veterinary professional has me looking at all issues. Please no comments in cat litter box behavior...I've spent my life helping others. I just wonder if he hates this whole contraption as much as I do?
It has not made litter disposal simpler, easier, cleaner or cheaper."

Books_5,0,"The only issue I have wih this product is that the ""leather"" covers does not resemble any leather I have worked with. I am concerned, since this comes from China that they be using dog skin, in which case, I would be extremely upset. China is not humane about collecting skins. They take them from dogs while the dog is still alive."

Kindle_Store_5,0,"I liked this story, not exactly sure why this one took me so much longer to read than the other Sapphire Falls books. It took me almost a month to read. Maybe it's because Lauren was trying so hard not to like a town I loved? All in all the book was good, I still can't get over how long it took me to read."
Pet_Supplies_5,1,"Good size, works as it should. The only problem is that it's too small for my dog. I bought this for a friend's cat and she's a huge fan of it. It's a little hard to get on her, but it's not really heavy. She's not afraid of it."

I love that they are made from organic cotton. I am very pleased with this purchase. I will be ordering more of these soon. Very good. I love that it is made of fiberglass. I am very happy with this purchase. I would not recommend this product."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,"I wasn't able to finish the job, but it worked out great.Nice little light.  Works as advertised.  The plastic parts are solid and the light is pretty sturdy.  The only thing I wish it had been a little thicker is the light switch.  If you have a light switch, it's a bit heavier, but the plastic part on the light switch is great.  I would buy it again.  I'm really glad I didn't buy it for the cheap price.This is my second one, but I've only used one. I was just getting a new one, and the first one that came with it was too big. I bought a second one, and it's now a 5/8""x5"" and the one I've had since I was 3 is a little smaller. I have no problems with this one. I'm just glad I bought it. I recommend this product.It's a great product, but the plastic is not very strong and the plastic part of the head was very rough.  I used it to make a mark on a wood vise.  The plastic was easy to remove, and I was able to remove it easily"

Toys_and_Games_5,0,"1. The best thing about this globe is the gorgeous colors.  Oranges, blues, gorgeous.
2. The textured terrain is wonderful.  Very instructive for a kid to ""feel"" the mountain ranges.
3. I have two complaints:  1) when it arrived in the mail, there was a chip in the paint, so the light seeped through. If it comes new with paint chip, it's going back!  2) this globe does not spin freely, and we all know, the best fun about a globe is the spin, so a kid can spin it and randomly point her finger to see what country she should go to....  that's the fun.

So, I'm still hunting for the perfect globe for a present for my grandniece, one that lights up, has a good easy spin, and has topographical texture...  the hunt continues...

forever,

While I enjoyed the story, I found myself drawn in to the characters' personalities and their struggles with family and loss.

I'm sure there will be more to come from the author and I will be hoping that she keeps this one coming!I really enjoyed this book, and I will definitely read more of it. I read it several times, and am still reading it, because it has such a great plot. I'll be reading more of the series, and I hope to see some more of the characters.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"I bought this vacuum cleaner 3 months ago and absolutely love it!! I am 69 and have a lot of difficulty maneuvering my heavy Kenmore canister vacuum anymore. I have had other stick or similar size vacuums before, but always ended up being disappointed in their performance. Not this one!! This machine is very light but does a fantastic job at picking up dirt in spite of its size. I like the fact that the ""footprint"" is not wide like the usual uprights as it can do a better job of going in tight spaces. I like the transparent cup which is easy to empty without getting dirty hands in the process, the fact that you do not need to buy paper filters, the easy to disassemble construction if you want to give it a thorough cleaning. I also like the sponge type of filter that you just need to rinse thoroughly when too dirty. I actually bought additional filters in case I needed to do soso I would not have to wait for it to dry. The first time I used it I was shocked at the amount of dirt and cat hair I amassed! This was the only time so far I have had to disassemble and clean the inner tube. You know you have to do so because you notice that the suction then is poor.
As you can see, I am tickled pink! This is the perfect vacuum for seniors or small apartments.
The only thing which would make it better: a handle on the front at the cup height to help hold it when vacuuming say stairs or sofa.  A hose attachment would be nice too but can be easily be done without the old fashion way (broom/ brush and rag) For the price and the performance and ease I do not believe it would be fair to remove a star.
Note: I had misplaced the instruction notice, and could not read the one posted on their website. I contacted Hoover, a very nice man answered and very courteously sent me a new one."
Kindle_Store_5,0,"When I first began reading ""Contessa,"" I wasn't sure if I could keep reading it. Livvy seemed like a spoiled brat and as the mother of a teenager, the last thing I wanted was for my escape (reading) to be like my reality.

But as I kept reading, my worries were put to rest and I loved this story as much as I loved Lori's ""Lost and Found"" series.

An amazing book and, as always, Lori tells an amazing story!"
Toys_and_Games_5,0,Had this when I was a kid and thought it was a lot of fun. Wanted my oldest granddaughter to have one because she really likes drawing. She loves it!  I'll probably have to buy 2 more once the other to granddaughter's are old enough.
Toys_and_Games_5,0,"If you have young WWE fans in your house (I kind of hope you don't, because that stuff is not well-suited to viewing for children!), they will probably enjoy playing with something like this. The recommended age for this toy is 6+, and I'd say that is probably about right. Many 6-year-olds will be able to assemble this toy, though some will struggle with it. Unless you want to assemble it yourself and keep repairing it yourself, you had better not give this to any kid younger than 6 years old.

This set CAN be assembled in many different configurations, and that will give it a bit more longevity in the life of its play. The biggest drawback to this toy is that it doesn't come with a single WWE action figure. It would take two to make it a ""complete"" toy, yet it doesn't even come with one. To me, that's just absurd. Every playset needs to come with one or more figures to populate it, and when I see manufacturers pumping out stuff like this that forces parents to purchase more stuff to even make it fun, it really grinds my gears. The action figures that are made for this playset run $20 each, so you can plan on spending an additional $40 on top of the cost of this set to even make it ""playable."" That makes it a $90 investment for a simple toy that will - in all likelihood - not be a great time consumer for your kids. Ridiculous! There are many better products for you to invest in that will produce longer play time and better stimulation of the imagination than this toy. Skip this one!

I just can't give a positive recommendation to something so incomplete."

One of them is disdainful towards any kind of scratching post -- but the other has ripped through several of the inexpensive $9 throw-away boxes. In fact there are at least two or three of them spread through the house, not counting the little crunchies left behind from enthusiastic scratching.

When I bought the PetFusion Cat Scratcher Lounge I worried a little bit whether spending this kind of money would be evidence that I've turned into a Cat Lady. Well, maybe I have... but at least I know I did not waste a cent. Because from the first moment that Shaka met this ""lounge"" (as you see in the video) she has claimed it as her own. It's a good thing that the other cat thinks it's ""meh,"" because Shaka would defend this with a temper tantrum.

Yes, it's on the large side. It's probably as big as some people's side coffee tables. That's fine for us because it has becomes the cat's regular perch, and (for a small cat) she stretches out very comfortably. And then she indulges in some dainty ripping-apart-of-cardboard as she scratches to her little heart's delight.

Fortunately as other reviewers have reported, it's constructed very well, with the cardboard FAR more dense than in the cheap scratching boxes you're thinking of. I won't need to replace this for a good long time."

Kindle_Store_5,0,"I loved the dynamic of this book. Club groupies (there is a better word but Im not sure if it would fly with the Zon) are often portrayed as horrible women so the blurb of this book really drew me in and once started I really was hooked. Harmony was very down to earth, but also took no crap which I loved. Her place in the club was more for her than it was anything else, and she would not let anybody put her down when it came to choosing what she did. Kit came in on his bike and was this knight for her and I love how fast he fell for her. Add and lots of club drama, very steamy scenes, amazing secondary characters and I have to say that Im hooked on the series. I cant wait to dive into the next one."

I will be ordering more!I wear a size 4 and these fit perfectly.  I bought a size 3 for my husband.  He loves them and I'm always a bit worried about the sizing.  I had to return them because the shoes were too small for my husband.  I'm sure if he wears them more he will be very happy.I got this for my son who is about 5'2"", he loves it, but it was a little tight around the chest. So I put it on and he loves it. It is a very good quality shirt and looks great on him.I bought these for my husband to wear for a Christmas party. He wears a size 11 and they fit him perfectly. My husband said they are comfortable and they are very well made. They are very soft and the fit is perfect. I really like the fit of the material and the fabric. They are very soft and comfortable. I wear them all the time.Love this shirt!!  It is a nice color and very flattering.  The material is nice and soft and it is a very comfortable shirt.

Kindle_Store_5,0,"To date, I have read Nikki's Secret, Text Message and Scrapping the Bone and I have to tell you, William Malmborg delivers. His stories are not for meek, but they are not so far out there that people will be offended or put off by reading them. What I love about Malmborg's work is that it is a little racey, a little raunchy and a whole lot of fun. The story lines flow. Once you start reading, you cannot stop. It's like opening up a huge bag of Dorito's and saying ""I'll just have a few"". Can't do it. You dive into one of his books and you will be reading until 4 am just to see what the heck Nikki's Secret is, or how is Mallory going to walk into that men's bathroom and do that thing? You just have to find out. Each book is a decadent pleasure, a pure delight that you can sink your teeth into and get lost in the process. Read this guy; if you like raunchy, sexy, a little crazy and a fabulous story."

Kindle_Store_5,0,I love the Sole Regret series and all the band members so I couldn't possibly pick a favorite but Gabe and Melanie definitely top my list.

Electronics_5,0,"I'm an old shaky-hand gentleman who had absolutely no problem replacing my headband cushion on my QC-15. Bose offers no replacement at all, so, I chose this to try. I watched their link to a video, noted all cautions and replaced in less than 15 minutes. I was worried an after-market product might cause it to not fit into the case. No fear was needed; it fit perfectly. Fit my head perfectly. I now have a like-new QC-15."
Movies_and_TV_5,0,"You know, I've been a fan of these Paranormal Activity movies since it debuted a few years ago. The first and second movies were pretty decent, although you can tell they were made on a low-budget. The first two relied more on getting to know the characters and heavily on very slow-building tension, which is why I loved them so much. That makes me wonder why this one just went off-track. PA3 is, quite literally, a weak mess of a movie. You'd think these guys would up the wow factor of this movie, considering how the first two were, but no. I know they were trying to tell the backstory to the series but they could do that and still wow us. The acting was very dry and that made it unbelievable to me. I mean, the knockoff movie:Paranormal Entity, was way better than this one. I was really disappointed and just can't recommend anyone buy this movie. If you can find it in a bargain bin somewheres, okay-maybe then. But for full asking price-No. These guys better get their game on in the next movie or fans are going to jump ship, plain and simple."
Toys_and_Games_5,0,"Batterys work great.  Gives a lot more flying time and great price.  The charger is slow and the biggest complaint would be that the lights indicating if a battery is being charged, flicker on and off if you bump the charger.  It does charge them, but could be better."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"As a recent new cat person, I purchased this for my cat to have a place to scratch, perch, and play. My cat was immediately interested in this condo, even as I was putting it together. Assembly wasn't too hard, I just followed what another reviewer had suggested and used a picture for reference. It should be noted that this unit is kind of HUGE. It is very tall! While the size works just fine for where I have it located, make sure to check the dimensions of your space before purchasing.

A few months after adopting my first cat, I adopted a second one. Both cats, each around 8 pounds, love to jump from the different perches. Though all the screws are tightened (something I check monthly as they tend to loosen over time), the whole thing does shake when they are running around on it. This does not seem to bother the cats, and therefore does not bother me. This unit has lived on hardwood floors and carpeting, neither flooring seems to aid or reduce in the amount of shaking. My cats do not spend much time in either cubby space, they mostly make use of the perches. While I love the blue color of this unit, it does highlight the amount of cat hair left behind. I vacuum the condo about once every 1-2 weeks.

I have had this unit for about 9 months and it has suffered a bit of damage. The highest perch is the most popular, and thus has suffered some minor shredding/tearing of the blue carpeting. The top hanging mouse has not survived, but the lower one is still hanging on. Finally, the base of the unit suffered some damage from my robot vacuum. I now block off the condo so that he cannot climb up it anymore (obviously not the cat trees fault).

Overall I think this is a great cat condo, and every time I see my cats playing on it, I feel happy."

Toys_and_Games_5,0,"We have had several Lamaze toys and this one was the favorite with all three of our children. I have found that babies love the crinkling noises best and these have very large wings that are easy to manipulate to make the sound.  My kids all loved the ladybug teether and the bright colors as well. This has a large strong clip that stays securely attached to the stroller, car seat and diaper bag. They have pulled so hard on this toy many times, putting their full weight on it and it doesn't stretch open and pop off like other clip-on toys have. I have thrown ours in the washing machine on gentle a few times and it has held up beautifully."

This is Miles & Hank's story, and it is filled with action, twists, self-discovery, determination and of course, a cute kid.

I am so looking forward to Sean & Hannah's story and am impatient to read what I expect to be as good as the last two.  I also hope this world's stories continue as I want to read more about Tito, the children & even the fallen.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,Loving this garment to pieces. Honestly I love many of this companies items because they fit so well. Normally I have to try something on or be there to gauge the ability for it to fit correctly. Not with this companies items or this garment alone. Be honest with the chart and the item will come to you in a great fit. I've purchased a few of these... washed and wore several times and so far the garment has held up it's moneys worth. Very flattering to the plus size lady. Would purchase from this company again and recommend.

Toys_and_Games_5,0,"I learned how to do the rubix cube a few years back but I hated how the stickers kept falling off, plus I wanted to try a speed cube. I am no expert at speed cubing but just going from a basic cube to this speed cube was a huge improvement on my time. This is a lot easier to maneuver. I use this cube at least once a week and haven't had any problems with it.

My daughter took this into her room once and came back out with a few pieces that came off. It was easy to put them back on. I can only think she tried to force it when one of the sides was slightly misaligned and that's what led to the pieces coming off but I haven't had that issue.

Sighting this in is a breeze. I used about 6 rounds at 100 yards. Then I aligned the backup sights and tested them, perfect.

The scope is rugged and well designed. If you haven't tried a red dot, you owe it to yourself. The parallax free optic makes acquisition incredibly fast and allows for both eyes to remain open. I don't know how they do it, therefore it's magic.

I would definitely buy this again. In fact I did. I replaced on 3-9x scope already and will replace more as funds are available. I am a big fan of these 1x parallax free red dots!"

The basic idea of the book is that we are going to look at the circumstances in a particular situation. This is a very good idea, but it is not a good one. The book is very well written and well presented. I was quite surprised to see that Mr. N. M. DeMille, the author of the book, wrote about how the crisis affected the economy, and how it affected the country. He went into detail about how the crisis affected the economy, and how it affected the nation. I found that this book was a good read. It is not a perfect read, but it is a good read.

Dont ask me why I took so long to read this book because I don't have a reason.  I am in love with Ms. Burtons Hope series and I am so glad that I did finally pick up this novella!!
I really enjoyed Will & Janes journey.  Both are just great.  Even if Jane is stubborn and determined to do it all on her own.  I could tell you everything that happens but what fun would that be.  (hint it wouldnt be any fun).
If you are a Hope fan and you have not read this novella yet?  You should and I think you will enjoy it very much.  If you are new to this series you don't have to start here but I think you should.

Toys_and_Games_5,0,"I ordered this tea set last week, after reading many reviews and contacting Green Toys. I asked the company about the leaky teapot problem which was mentioned in several lower-star reviews. A company representative responded, assuring me that the design of the teapot had been changed to fix the leak problem.
It is evident that the leak problem has been fixed; it no longer has a seam around the middle of the teapot that was causing the leak problem. It should be noted that the lids of the teapot and sugar bowl are no longer interchangeable; the teapot lid is much bigger than the sugar bowl.

I love that the set is cute, made in the USA, dishwasher-safe, able to hold liquid, and came in awesome packaging (even though that only matters when you first get it, it's so nice to have the frustration-free packaging! Why can't every company package items this way?)

I originally gave this 4 instead of 5 stars because:
  The tea set seemed smaller than I thought it would be (but it's actually just right for my 2-year-old, so I actually wouldn't want it any bigger)
  The green plates are  a lime green instead of the soft pastel pictured
  The teapot lid isn't as pictured (but is now leak-free!) and isn't interchangeable with the sugar bowl lid
  While the set appears durable, there are some small flaws that appear to have occurred in the manufacturing process. My daughter tripped and fell on the sidewalk while carrying a teacup and the plastic is scraping off a little bit from where it hit the ground.
  You may need to have your toddler hold the lid while pouring. It stays on with careful, gentle use, but also falls off sometimes.
  It could be priced a little lower (say $15-$18 instead of $20).

Bottom line: Definitely worth getting, not quite perfect. I would still buy this tea set and am happy with the purchase."
Books_5,1,"I don't understand the high point of the book, which is how far this book has fallen from the high points of the book. The book is written as if it were a 4 star book. It is written as if it were a 5 star book. This is a farce. I don't think it's a fair book, but it is a farce. It has no redeeming qualities. This book is a farce.

Books_5,0,I thought the writing was entertaining and very genuine but not mature enough.  I couldn't wait to finish the book .... I had to scan through the last few pages.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"It makes great popcorn. It's fairly fast. It doesn't require a lot of oil.

But as some others have noted, the plastic cover is fragile. Drop it once, or even bump it hard, and it will crack. Attempts to glue mine back together have not been very successful. One source for a replacement dome charges $23; the current price of a whole new unit is $29.

For being cheap in the design and unreasonable about the replacement part cost, they get kicked down from 5 stars to 3.

Adequate to the task if you are gentle with it. I wouldn't recommend it for a house full of children, though.

It's a pity they didn't reinforce the rim; that's all it would have taken to make this a great little unit."

Books_5,0,"Dickens, along with Dostoevsky, stands atop my list of novelists who could most accurately portray the subtleties of human emotion and passion.  ""Great Expectations"" is simply a masterpiece of 19th-century fiction, and is pure Dickens.  In this semi-autobiographical work (a trademark of Dickens' writings), the life of a poor young boy, Pip, is followed from his humble beginnings to his rise into the middle-class, due to the mysterious aid of an unknown benefactor.  His pursuit of Estella, a beautiful young girl raised to break the hearts of men by her jilted caretaker, Ms. Havisham, is a classic of literature that has been repeated countless times since.  The tragic, gradual break between Pip and his family (particularly the humble but caring Joe) is heartwrenching.  Pip's eventual realization of the insincerity of the middle class, and his love for Joe, brought tears to my eyes.
""Great Expectations"" is a wonderful, moving book that has been copied and satired again and again, from Mishima's ""Forbidden Colors"" to South Park.  An important and unforgettable novel!"
Books_5,0,"If you're a fan of Inkheart and of science fiction or alternate reality, this is the perfect for you. In this alternated world in 1985 in Britain, time travel is routine, cloning is a reality (dodos have been resurrected,) and literature is taken very seriously. People can get lost in poems and stories, and first editions are forged. This is all usual for Thursday Next, a literary detective. But then someone begins kidnapping characters from stories. And when Jane Eyre is kidnapped, Thursday has to track down the villain and go into the novel herself. This is a really great book; playful and wonderful. I loved the world-building in the book, though there were a lot of specialized terms that you had to learn to make sense of the story. Also, I really liked the character of the villain, Acheron Hades. He was so deliciously evil. And seemingly invincible. Fforde's writing style was really great too; you know, that British style. It was straightforward but also had dry humor. And action, but not too much action. Fforde is actually from Wales, I think. This is the first book in the Thursday Next series, which includes Lost in a Good Book, The Well of Lost Plots, and Something Rotten. *You can read all of my reviews at my book review blog, novareviews. blogspot."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"I bought this bag used via craigslist at a third of the cost of new for my wife who is 5' 1"" for 'anger management'.  I tried to use the unit also myself (GLOVES are a MUST).
I am 5'10"" 200+ pounds. I over-filled the unit over the recommended 270# with 280# of sand. I added 2 gallons of water also from an old milk container. Each gallon adds 8.3# to the container. (Sand has plently of air-space for water to fill!)
I made the mistake of buying eight 40# bags of sand (which was moist) from wal-mart and it took 2 hours to get the sand into the unit via a large mouth funnel. The sand kept sticking to the funnel and I had to push it through by hand. If you fill unit with sand, make sure your sand has been washed and DRIED! Lowes hardware has VERY good 50# white dried-playsand.
The unit has a 'cap/plug' in the top of the unit which looks like it would un-screw. Trust me... it does NOT. It is fused-molded into unit.
I ended up cutting a 1 1/2"" threaded PVC female adapter into the top of the unit in place of the molded cap, and used two-part epoxy to 'glue' to the unit. I then used 1 1/2"" plug to seal top.
I ended up buying 100#s more of sand. This time DRIED! Went in through the top in 5 minutes.
I then added 2-more gallons-of-water to the sand. Giving my boxing set-up 430+ pounds of weight. (including all the plastic)
Note* I would not use this unit on a second floor room. The weight will shake the floor. (Apartment people take note)I have had to move to first floor! (NOT FUN! A good Dolly a MUST at point it is filled with sand)
If the unit is only filled with water, it makes some annoying swishing noise of the water motion inside.
My wife loves this unit... I have heard her use it several times late at night. Now her running friends 'join' in on the boxing fun."
Toys_and_Games_5,1,"I had previously bought a few of these as a Christmas gift, and they were a hit with my son. He is now 8 months and is still learning to fly. This is a great toy and he loves it. The size is perfect and the wings are very long."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,It does what I intended.  It has a heavy rubber smell that is slow to dissipate. It helps but I sweat so much that I am not sold that it really helps my situation.  My eyes do not burn anymore and I guess I should be happy with that.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"I bought one of these units in 2008 when I saw one on the news.  I checked my area on the Internet and saw I lived in a red zone for radon.  When I received it and let it settle in for 2 days, the level was 6.0.  The EPA said 4. O is the highest safe level for radon.  I called to have a radon removal system installed.  Very quickly the level dropped to 1.9 and the company guaranteed their system would keep it that low.  Now for the problem.  It did stay a 1.9 for about 3 years but then a power outage came and the unit then, after being reset, read 2.0.  Later, another power outage came and the unit read 2.1.  Lastly, after another outage, it read 2.2.  Finally, a long outage came and the unit never recovered and all it would show was two dashes.  I think it got fried little by little.  But all in all, I'm ready to buy another one but I will plug it into a surge protector this time.  At one point in time during the higher readings, I did call the company and the person I spoke to did tell me that the unit did not--NOT-- need to be re-calibrated.  That is why I think it got fried from a power surge. So, you might want to invest in a good surge protector for this product if you have one or buy one.

Update:  The day after I wrote the above.  Husband reset the unit's memory and let it ""smell"" the air for over 48 hrs.  Now the reading is .08 and it seems to be working just fine.  I think maybe (what do I know?) the power surges did do something to it for it to keep jumping up like it did but now, with a reset memory, it is working great.  Keep the instructions that come with it in case you have to reset your unit someday."
Electronics_5,0,"I've been using this tablet for about a year. It's a good tablet for the price.  There are three problems that may affect your purchase. It does not have enough disk space. I use it mainly to read newspapers, surf the web, read email and play one game. I have Office installed. No other software yet there isn't enough space for updates.  The second problem is battery life. This says 6 hours. Maybe on standby but if you are using the tablet, expect that you'll only get 2-3 hours. Lastly the keyboard is awful. I do not have large hands but the keys are so small that I'm constantly deleting text or bringing up a pop up menu. I have a third party external keyboard that I bought to use with this and its a wireless full sized keyboard that works well. But I'm don't always have it nearby. So if you can live with these shortcomings and can get it on sale (I paid 105.00 for it), then it's worth it. Otherwise looking."

Electronics_5,0,"I was looking for a sturdy waterproof camera for my daughter. I wanted a good quality camera that could stand up to the mishaps of an eleven year old. She is in love with this camera because of all of the neat features that it has. She is able to take selfies with the frontal view of the camera allowing her to see herself. It is shock proof and so far it stands up to that fact as she has dropped it several times, knowing at times she can be clumsy this camera has given me the tranquility to know that this camera will outstand some of the abuse.

The down side that I have found with this camera is that it uses batteries and no charger. We fixed the problem by buying recharger batteries, which is great because she uses the camera quite a lot. Using a 2gb seems to go pretty fast, so I definitely recommending to get a bigger mini memory card. This will help from needing to remove or transfer pictures to another device. The batteries seems to hold for the usage, so don't be scared that it won't last long. Definitely recommend the product!"

The last scene was a bit too long and I didn't care for it. I was happy to see that the film ended after a few minutes. I thought that maybe it was the ending.

Kindle_Store_5,0,"Leather & Lace: Inferno Glory MC #1 by J.A. Fredericks is the first book in the Inferno Glory MC four-part serial. It is the story of Harley Sonnick and Colt Sawyer. It is NOT a rosy and warm story full of happy feel-good moments. It is a story filled with mistakes, regrets, deceit, danger, and betrayal.

We meet Harley when she is fresh out of prison. She just served three years for a crime she was set up for and unknowingly committed. She lost her dad while she was locked up, his battle with lung cancer finally over. She goes to the only place she has ever called home, the Inferno Glory MC clubhouse. When she gets there, the man who has always been another father figure to her turns his back on her. This is when she meets Colt. With no place to go she begrudgingly takes him up on his offer to crash at his place for a short while. It doesn't hurt that he is OFF THE CHARTS HAWT!!!!

Colt is instantly enamored with the vixen on two wheels and jumps at the chance to be her (paraphrasing book) knight in a leather cut riding in on his black hog to save her. The love/lust is kinda insta-lust that grows into some deep feelings fast and the sex is raunchy and will melt your undies right-off.

Despite the romantic aspect there is an undercurrent of subterfuge and suspense and the book ends on a cliffhanger in anticipation of the next book, Pleasure & Pain: Inferno Glory MC #2. I thoroughly enjoyed this quick read and can't wait to see what's going to happen next!"
Electronics_5,0,"Before purchasing I was a little leary, both of the bright room concerns voiced earlier and of buying from an Amazon associated company, not Amazon itself.  Purchasing a month ago, both fears were unfounded.

Electronic Express was fine, shipping on Monday after a Friday order via FedEx Ground.  The box was strapped vertically to a pallet and the driver helped removing it from the pallet and using a hydraulic platform to get it to the ground and into the house.  Net result:  no shipping nor delivery problems.  The set worked perfectly upon arrival.

As to the picture and operations, I have it on an HDMI connection from a DirecTV HD satellite connection.  The black level is as astonishing as they advertise and the picture as clean and crisp as I observed earlier (at a Sears where they had this, the Sharp and the Sony side-by-side, with the Samsung as good as the Sony and much better than the Sharp).

We are in Florida, where the sun is known to be particularly bright and this room has huge western sky facing windows.  There is a little sun glare and reflection in the very late afternoon but all parts of the screen are still easily viewable and after a few minutes any annoyance from glare and reflection is tuned out by one's eyes.  In sort, there's no problem here with the issue.

Highly recommended for the price and overall quality.

Addendum (December 2009):  Well, a month after the warranty expired, so did this product.  I had an authorized Samsung repair shop look at it and the LCD drivers had failed.  Great, I thought, a simple circuit board change.  WRONG!  That circuit board was ""married"" to the display so the entire display needed to be replaced.  $1500 plus labor!  Short result:  the Samsung was junked and a reliable Sony replacement purchased.  Star rating reflects the unconscionable cost of repair of a somewhat simple problem."

I'll see how they hold up and post an update in a few months"

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"I love this water infuser! I've been using it to make cucumber/lime water to drink and I can't wait to try some other combos. It came with two free sphere ice molds which was nice but they kept leaking before I could get a good sphere. I more than likely won't be using them.

As for the water bottle it's been getting regular use in my house. Regular ice cubes fit well in the infuser insert and still leave room for any fruit or whatever you're infusing your water with.

The infuser insert was a little hard for me to pull out (it could just be me) but don't let that deter you from getting this bottle. There are slits on the sides of the infuser insert to let the water mix with whatever is inside the insert. You can even use the bottle without the insert if you'd just like to use it as a regular water bottle.

The top has a convenient handle to carry the bottle around and the plastic it's made out of is bpa free. The opening of the bottle is open and does not have a spout which in my opinion is much better because it makes it so much easier to clean.

Out of the couple infuser water bottles I've owned in the past, this one is getting the most use because it's a little bit easier to clean and convenient to carry around.

Toys_and_Games_5,0,"We got this for our 2 and a half year old for Christmas, who loves trains. Yes, he loves the train but the coupling is very weak and loose and does not hold together well.  Also, for the price, there are very few train parts, and a lot of superfluous plain old dup.os.  Also, this item does not come with a track, although from the looks on the box, you might think so.  Another thing is that the figures that come with it are larger than other duplo sets, so they will not fit in other duplo vehicles, and the train roof will not close if they are inside. Not so much for the price. I would buy the circus train that duplo sells much cheaper."

Electronics_5,0,"Nice case.  Swallowed a Sabertooth x99 with H100 water cooler with only very minor hiccups.

Pros:
- very easy to assemble
- Can work with H100i cooling unit with 2 fans
- has rubber grommets for H100i
- decent cable management
- adjustable position of rear fan
- room for additional front fan
- padding to absorb sound on sides
- removable filters front and bottom

Cons:
- top cover must be left off if using water cooler (ugly --see photo) would prefer a 2 piece cover of some kind
- No fan control
- only 2 usb ports on front
- Should have top cutout for 12v MoBo power (was a stretch)
- Tight fit for water unit near Top hdd cage

I think it would take an h110i (has holes for 140mm mounting, but no grommets), but wouldn't guarantee.  As it is the fans just clear the motherboard and the top 2 drive bays can't be used for full length drives with a h100i installed.

I like that the case allowed all the wiring to be run behind the mobo, but running the 12v cable was a tight fit and pushes up against the RAM slots at the right edge.  It would be nicer if there had been a cutout at the top of the mobo to allow a straight run behind.  Cutting it myself seemed like too much work given that the cable fit as is."

Seems put together well; the boots have a little Velcro strap to try and keep them down around the shoe. The outfit was easy for him to put on; the cape comes off for easy changing and he had a little wiggle room so he can wear some long underwear or thermals under it when we go out trick-or-treating. The mask fits perfect as well; there are little cushions in the mask so the plastic isn't right on his face. So far, very good buy; cheap and fits him perfectly."

Movies_and_TV_5,0,"Alien Nation isn't just a sci-fi show masquerading as a cop show.  It's equal & intelligent measures of both and reminds the viewer what can be accomplished when serious treatment of science fiction is presented to a mainstream audience.

Too often Sci-Fi gets a ""cult"" label - something only Star Trek or Star Wars people should watch or love.  However, when you look at the lists of the most profitable movies of all time, you find many science fiction titles - E.T. The Extraterrestrial, Terminator 2: Judgement Day and of course the Star Wars films.  If so many people are going to see these movies, then how can one justify the ""cult"" label?  To be fair, there is much sci-fi that isn't done well, however when it's a focused production like Alien Nation, audiences are treated to quality, intelligent entertainment with more than just car chases and gun fights.

Unfortunately FOX didn't include any extras on this release, but at least we have these great episodes.  Treat yourself to great, memorable stories and characters and pick up this DVD set."
Movies_and_TV_5,1,"You might not expect it, but it does feel like a real science fiction story.

While the plot is very simple, the characters are complex, and the plots are very interesting.

I highly recommend this movie for anyone who likes sci-fi and adventure, because it is well made, well acted, well acted, well written, well acted, well acted, and it has great action.

If you are a fan of sci-fi, then you should definitely check out this movie, as it is one of the best sci-fi movies you'll ever see.

Electronics_5,0,"Pros- Great picture, slim design, light weight, 3d conversion is pretty cool.
Cons- Samsung App store is a joke, at best.  If you are only buying the TV for that, wait for a while to see if ""Smart TV's"" really take off.  No one is writing apps for them yet and the ones that are out are pretty lame/useless/not fun.  Even the YouTube app doesnt work with the keyboard side of the TV remote...fail.

Update (a little over one year later 12/30/2012)
Picture is still amazing and the small edges set this TV apart; best i've ever seen...it does have 240hz refresh rate (not CMR...what a joke).
The app store has not gotten much better.  I enjoy the CNET app, which is pretty much the only one I've downloaded after the fact that was worth anything.

Oh...3d glasses are HORRIBLE.  They do not last.  I have 1/4 that is still alive after a year.  The 2 i bought seperate from the TV (same model number as the ones that came with) didn't work all that great the moment i took them out of the box.
Even if they were working properly, don't expect to make it all the way through a long movie like Avatar without them dying on you.  that is awkward when you have to offer your pair to one of your guests and then they know you are sitting there watching a blurry picture.

I marked it up for my youngest son, just starting out as an adult. Then I bought two more copies - one for oldest son, and another to replace mine. Adams' style is accessible and clear.

A few key takeaways:

- Use systems, not goals
- Try not to sell your time due to limited upside; your time is finite and limited
- Try to find a product that is infinitely scalable, that you can sell again and again (Intellectual Property might be one way)
- Piecing together complementary skills can make you _very_ much more effective
- Look to maximize your personal energy - the foundation of all else

The above are all key enablers for someone starting off. Scott Adams lays out a system to effectively experiment your way to personal success.

Kindle_Store_5,0,"This is one of those marriages of convenience, a trope I often like.  The hero is turned off women, resenting his mother and all the shallow, greedy women of the ton she tries to marry him off to.  The heroine is distrustful of men because of having the most horrendous, abusive father you could ever imagine.  A father who's arranging her marriage to an older ship captain and white slaver, who equals or surpasses the father in horrendous behavior.

She runs away from home to escape marriage and he runs away from London, basically for the same reason, except in his case he wasn't really in any desperate situation.

Well, you know what will happen by reading the blurb but not exactly all the particulars, some of which are fun and interesting.  No real unicorn here, of course, but the symbolism plays a part in the story.  There are also some entertaining secondary characters, although nobody is drawn with much dimension.

However, this is not Chater's best work.  I did not like the hero much. Too immature, too erratically friendly and then cold and almost mean to the heroine.  Still, the writing is good.  Chater knows her way around words and sentences, but I have to like the hero in my romance to be completely satisfied."

Books_5,1,"Who wouldnt want to get into a book with a third person perspective. The premise of the story is that the publisher, a former publisher, is planning to publish a novel by a young author. It will be a short story about two teenage girls who are attacked in a bar by a man who is trying to kill them. The story starts with a young girl sitting in a bar and a man who seems to be an alcoholic. The story goes on and on about the man's behavior and how the girl has developed relationships with him and with his friends. When the story ends, the book is over and the next chapter is over. It is a fun story and I would recommend this book to any young person. I have read several of the other stories in this series and I have enjoyed them all.

Kindle_Store_5,0,"What a terrible end to this series.  I loved this character and her gargoyles from the first novella that I read but this book was technical with almost no heart or development for the few characters there were.  I was completely bored with the formation of crystals and what it took to form the crystals.  I felt like I was in a cave forming crystals through out most of the book.  That is what I mean by the book being too technical.  If there was such a thing as gargoyles, this would be the manual on how to make your own gargoyle. The writer spent way too much time on that and not enough time on developing the romance and bringing life to the final story in this series.  I miss the people and the gargoyles from the previous books.  This book felt like a novella that was dragged out."

Electronics_5,0,"A quick explanation of the title. I have severe to profound loss of hearing in the mid to high frequency range and my Sharp LC60LE835U become just about unintelligible with its poor speakers (wonderful picture). Was looking to go CC but, after reading the reports of soundbars, decided to try one last thing. Had a 5:1 Bose system whose speaker system couldn't easily be connected after moving into a new home. It came down to the Sony CT-150 and the Yamaha ATS 1010 (from Costco). The decision was made after reading that I could use my powered sub-woofer with the Yamaha, plus its great glossy black looks matched the TV, blueray (& Cisco VCR .. to some extent).
Real simple optical connection from TV, and wow! ... I could now hear with clarity, from movies to TV series. I replayed a couple of TV shows & movies that I had previously had real difficult time in understanding, and now had a whole different audio experience. A boon for baby boomers for sure.
Now for the short list of cons, not deal breakers but folks should be aware of them. The built-in sub-woofer is simply not up to the job - get an external unit to really appreciate the bass (especially in movies).  The surround sound is not wondrous, and to advertise it as a 7:1 experience is just plain deceptive. Yamaha should get real with its claims about this aspect. However, I would imagine this unit is just about there with others in this class and no-one in their right minds can really expect a decent surround sound from a soundbar.
To conclude, the Yamaha far exceeded my expectations in uplifting my TV experience - if you have similar hearing loss, just give this a try."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Understanding that all wax seals will eventually fail, I researched the alternatives and purchased this Danco seal and a Fluidmaster rubber seal - in case one didn't work properly. The toilet it was to be used with is about a year old and is from the American Standard ""Mainstream"" family.

The floor is tiled and level. The toilet flange is the newest PVC flange that Oatey makes, is ""above the floor"", and level.

The specs on this Danco seal state that it will work with flanges that are ""above the floor"", up to 1/2"" tall.

This seal didn't compress enough to allow the toilet to sit flush with the floor. It just rocked side to side. There was no error with the installation as the toilet was repositioned several times to ensure that a proper ""set down"" onto the Seal was made. There just simply wasn't enough room between the outlet on the bottom of the toilet and the top of the flange for this Seal to fit into.

You know what worked? The cheapie old Harvey wax ring. Prepped and placed the toilet down the first time and flush the toilet sits.

Maybe this Danco Seal works for some combinations of toilets and flange heights - but if you want to save yourself some grief, purchase and have on hand the good ole' wax ring just in case you're in the predicament I was in.

Toys_and_Games_5,0,"I don't prefer any of the stand-alone variations to the original Carcassonne and its expansions, but Gold Rush is definitely my favorite of them.

Compared with the original:
-Railroads score similarly to roads (score double if only one tile has a locomotive)
-Farmers score based on native villages (2 points each) and horse riders (4 points each) in the field
-Mountains score the number of gold nuggets showing on the tiles
-A City tile scores 3 points for each complete connected railway
-At game's end, acquired mining tokens are revealed, gold is tallied and added to the final score

Gold Rush is challenging in a couple of ways. You only get 4 meeples, so throwing out that farmer too early will limit your options more than in the original game.  Placing one on a city tile is also risky, because you don't get it back until all connecting railroads are completed.  Also, other players can place a tent into a mountain your worker is attempting to mine, and they can mine it too (with some limitations). When you score the mountain you get all unclaimed tokens, but unless you did it quickly, there might not be any left to claim.

I don't much like the surprise victory points from the mining tokens at the end. It would be more strategic to know the value of what you have acquired as the game progresses, but that's a minor thing.  I really like the economy of decisions, in which you can choose not to place a worker, and instead take a mining token from a mountain you have claimed, or move your tent to a different tile within a mountain that contains more mining tokens.  The direct competition for mining tokens is a nice change of pace for me, but others might not like this aspect.  Overall, I think there's a slightly elevated tension in this variation of what is usually a pretty casual game, and I really enjoy it."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,"I was excited to get this set, as it is a very nice piece of equipment.  It is so small that it is not worth the extra money you spend on it.  The only thing I would change is the size of the curtain.  This is a very good curtain.  I would recommend this to anyone who has a large curtain and wants to add a little more detail to their curtain.  I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a very classy curtain.love this!  it works well, but I wish it was more sturdy, not just the front and back of the lid.  it doesn't have a lot of weight to it.  I had to buy two sets to make it.I bought these to use in a dresser for a baby shower.  They work great.  I used them for our shower.  We had them on our bed and they were pretty heavy.  I used them for the bedding for a 5 year old and she loves them.  They are very soft and comfortable.  The color is exactly as pictured.  They are very soft and wash well.  They are not heavy.  I would definitely recommend these.  I was worried they might not last long.  They are great for the price.  I would buy these again.  I hope they last a long time.I've had a few of these for a few months now and they haven't cracked or cracked. I have tried a couple of them and they're all so much easier to clean. They're not so much thicker than some of the others I've tried, but they're still so thick and easy to clean"

Toys_and_Games_5,0,"It's a fabulous hat. Yes, it is a bit pricy, but it's worth it! It's lightweight and it doesn't fit too tightly. I normally can't wear headbands etc for very long without getting a headache, but I wore this for several hours for my daughter's ""Wonderland Tea Party"" themed birthday party. My daughter can wear it as well - so it works both for kids and grown-ups AND you slide the hat around on the headband (It doesn't slide around by itself), so you can decide which side of your head you want to place the hat - it's just perfect! PS: I quickly found out that the loose hanging ends of the hat-ribbon/ sash drove me crazy, but it was easily solved by tying it into a pretty bow that instantly stayed in place, and added a feminine touch to it. Awesome product  that will last a long time!"

Kindle_Store_5,1,"OK first of all at this point I thought the author was a bit of a prude and I wasn't too impressed with the story.  The heroine was a bit of a golem with a bad attitude and in the end she was a bit of a loner.  The book had a bit of a romance going on between the two characters and it was a little predictable.  I just didn't care for the heroine's actions.  I don't think I will read more about her in future books.

Overall, I loved this story.  I just didn't get it.  It was a bit slow paced, but it kept my interest.  I'll be looking for more by this author.I love this series, and this story is awesome. It's a great story about a strong woman who is"

Then tried it on Kindle Fire and could hear no difference. On mp3 player maybe some volume but hard to really tell. Bottom line I can not-repeat-not recommend this.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"These are amazing pliers. They're incredibly well made and can take massive amounts of abuse. They're also capable of grabbing huge things, which can be really useful. They are definitely more expensive than other similar pliers, but they're also better made. I use them while working on cars all the time. The teeth on these pliers make them ideal for grabbing radiator hoses and coaxing them off barb fittings. Breaking old, stubborn hoses off radiators can be a huge pain and these pliers make that job much much easier. I have at least one of every size Cobra that Knipex makes from the really tiny to the comically large. I also highly recommend the Knipex Pliers Wrench series of pliers if you're looking for a set of adjustable jaw pliers that won't mar the heck out of everything."

Movies_and_TV_5,0,"I ran accross this one by suprise at the store, and Being a carlin fan, it was a no brainer.  Carlin has many great HBO specials over the years, but this one definitly is getting towards probably one of is last.  Carlin unfortunately really is starting to show his age, but his opening rant was great.  But from their the jokes were ok, solid for a few good laughs and moments, but not as memorable as many of his past performaces, and nothing that will stick like them either. HE has so much work, at some point you expect a bit of a let off.  But, it was good to see him out still doing it. Although his political correctness is probably the worst ever, what do you expect, it's Carlin.  Check it out, worth watching, especially if you are doing a Carlin marathon..this one is more like a warm up act, then break out some of his classics and you have a funny evening with a great comic legend of our day."
Movies_and_TV_5,1,"Before watching this movie I saw an amazing movie about a man who becomes obsessed with the paranormal and the other paranormal.  The movie is a bit cheesy, but it's a very entertaining movie.I had no idea that this film would be so well written and acted.  The acting is great.  The story is well told and the locations are beautiful.  The acting is great.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a great film to watch.  A must have for any horror fan.I have watched this movie since it was first released on VHS and loved it.  I have watched it many times and it still holds up to the test of time.  The story was a bit different then the first movie and the acting was good.  I was a little disappointed in the ending.  I was hoping for a good ending.  I don't really know what the ending was about but I thought it was a good ending.  It was a very good movie and I am happy to have it on DVD.  The movie was very well done and was very well acted.  The acting was also very good and I loved it.  I recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a good movie to watch.  I recommend it.I got this in the mail and was so excited to get it."

Electronics_5,0,"Computer speakers always seem very expensive for as crappy as they are.  You can get great speakers for your car for easily under $100.

While they are adequate, high quality sound should not be expected.  They do work though and are reasonably stylish.  They could have used a little longer cable.  I had to put left on right and right on left to reach my tower which sits to the left of my desk.  The speakers are mounted a little high on the hutch though."

The only downside is that it's very small. The mount is designed to be a little too large for a regular desk mount, so it might be a bit too big for most people.

The only downside is that it's a bit heavier than I'd like it to be. It has a standard length of 4"

Pet_Supplies_5,1,"This is my first time using this and the dogs love it. My only complaint is the extra suction cup. I wish it came in the plastic one so it would hold up to the biting and biting. I would have liked it if it had a thicker plastic bowl. I would have liked to have gotten it in the plastic one instead. It has a very thin plastic base, so I wish I had bought it in the plastic one. I will have to check the size on the next time. I will update this review as I see it. I am really glad I bought this product. I would not have bought it in the plastic one. I have been using this to keep my dogs ears clean for several years and I have found it to be effective. It is very absorbent and absorbs more than my other shampoo products. I have not had any issues with skin irritation as a result. My cats love this food. They are about 20 lbs. They have been eating it for several years. The cats have never had any issues with the food, and I believe that it is a healthy food for them. I also have the odd cat that we mix with it, which is quite a challenge for us. The food is good quality and the cats love it. I will be ordering more of the other brands. Great quality. My dogs love it. I bought this for a friend who has a dog with a sensitive stomach. It's very easy to clean. It's not the best and there are some ways to get it out. I haven't used it yet but it seems to be working well."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"I purchased the Paula Deen steamer as a replacement for a Cuisinart steamer so I'll be comparing it to that.  Overall, the PD unit is pretty well made.  It's lightweight, but not thin walled.  The steamer fits very snug to the pot and does an admirable job letting condensed water seep through the holes.  I thought it did a better job of this then the Cuisinart unit.  This is probably due to the slightly larger steamer holes in this unit.

What I love most about this steamer is the rubber like wrapping of the handles and lid.  This keeps both the steamer and the lid cool enough to handle even when the pot has been boiling for a long time.  The Cuisinart did not have this and it's definitely a plus!  What's also better in the PD steamer is its resistance to staining; cleaning up is pretty easy.

What I don't like is what keeps this unit from getting 5 stars; the design of the base.  The base has a concave design, that is it's flat on the outside, but the metal depresses in towards the middle.  Why is that a problem?  Because this means the bottom doesn't get full contact with the ceramic stovetop that I use which means I spend more time waiting for water to boil, alot more time then the Cuisinart.  The PD unit has a copper plated bottom, which should mean a faster and more efficient heat transfer, but there's just not enough of the metal to make contact.  If you're using a gas stove, then this is irrelevant.  I'm guessing it was designed this way to save money by cutting material costs, but it will end up costing me more in the long run with a higher electric bill.  I would have gladly paid $5 more if the bottom were flat.

Overall I am happy with the purchase and would buy it again if I had to."

Maybe their German origin can be blamed.

It is an elaborate, but passive, molded plastic toy, like ""free"" toys included with some kid's meals by big chains, but much bigger.  The excitement may not be proportional to the toy's size.

It is doubtful that children of age 5+ are capable to appreciate its masterful quality resulting in the relatively high price.

Children ages 10-12 have many more options than pushing passive toys.  Thus, the upper range of the 5-12 years age bracket of children the toy is intended to seems exaggerated.  However, it is well made, durable, easy to wipe and clean, and should by attractive to children ages 5-9, if they convince the parents to spend, and - of course - to hobbyists of age up to 100."

The Ridgid has a very thin blade and it has a lot of power. The Ridgid has a good grip and the Ridgid is very comfortable. I would recommend the Ridgid over the Ridgid combo. This is a great tool for small jobs. It works well for small jobs. I'm not sure why I got it for this price, but it's definitely a good value. I've used this one to get around a ceiling fan on my garage. I don't know if it's the one that I've had since I was a kid, or the one that I used to use to get around the ceiling fan. It was very well made and was easy to install. It was easy to adjust the fan speed and the speed and the height of the fan. The height was easy to adjust, so you could adjust the height of the fan, the height of the fan and the height of the fan. It was easy to install and it was easy to adjust the height of the fan.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Only needing a CO detector in one room, I don't think these combo CO/smoke detectors are a very good idea.  (Maybe if I needed a lot of CO detectors I would, however.)  Make sure you save the directions, as well as memorize how many horn beeps there are for smoke and how many there are for carbon monoxide.  Also, the directions make it seem like there is a smoke LED and a CO LED, when there is only one for both.  In addition, you are not suppose to need to replace the batteries during the 10-year-life of the detector, since it has ""sealed, ten year lithium batteries"", yet the directions state there is a ""low battery chirp"" and tells you to install ""2 new AA batteries"" if that chirping happens?!  (Can you or can you not replace the batteries without deactivating the detector?)  Moreover, if you end up having to deactivate the detector for any reason, it becomes that week's trash.  (Only, you can't throw it in the trash.)  Finally, the directions say to test the detector once a week!  (Yeah, sure, especially if you have a lot of them.)  I don't think 10-year detectors are a good idea at all.  If you are required by law to have them, my sympathy to you.  For anyone wanting a CO detector by itself, I highly recommend the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/First-Alert-CO615-Dual-Power-Carbon-Monoxide-Plug-In-Alarm-with-Battery-Backup-and-Digital-Display/dp/B000Q5VMKG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">First Alert CO615 Dual Power Carbon Monoxide Plug-In Alarm with Battery Backup and Digital Display</a>, and there are plenty of decent smoke detectors out there that don't last 10 years.

Books_5,0,"I greatly enjoyed the Decker/Lazarus early books at the beginning of the series.  They were character driven and shared the lives of the main characters, Peter Decker and Rina, as their relationship grew into marriage and family.  More literary in writing style and with characters you came to care about, you almost forgot the books were in the ""Mystery"" genre.  Admittedly, I hadn't read a number of the novels in the middle of the series, but jumped to ""Gun Games"".  Although the elements of the early Decker/Lazarus novels were there, it seemed more ""commercially"" than ""character"" driven.  The ""F"" word abounds and even when it might fit the character and situation; it is over used.  Other graphic sexual terms and situations are also included.  The book seemed a mixed up jumble of young teenaged romance and sex with a mystery thrown in involving more of the same.  That said, the main characters, the foster son of Decker and Rina, 15 year old, Gabe, and his 14 year old girlfriend, are characters you like and hope to see as adults moving on with their lives in a later book.  But a lot less of the sexual details and foul language would be nice!"

They are beautiful with the silver embellishments and the leather is nice, but not the foot area or bottom.  I wanted these so badly, but they aren't made for me."
Books_5,0,"I mostly liked this book and read it quickly. Hoever I wasn't satisfied with the ending. It left too many questions unanswered and some things just didn't make sense. For example, why was Truscott always following Alex and how did he get all of hs inside information? How could Truscott and Michael Bell know that Alex went to Vermont? How could they end up at the gas station in the rental car without being seen? There were no other buildings around so someone new showing up would be seen. Why wouldn't Alex have heard the shot when Michael Bell killed Truscott. So, basically I liked the book a lot but the ending was a big let down."

Kindle_Store_5,1,I loved this set.  I love the fact that you can't go wrong with a strong female lead.  I love the fact that both Finn and Carrie are strong and determined.  The story was well told and kept me engaged.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"This is a very pretty pendant that couldn't look lovelier on my wife. All of the pink, purple and white of the stones and the gold coloring of the silver work together very nicely. I'm proud to have been able to get this pendant and chain for my wife, it definitely caught my eye when I picked it out. Where the pendant hooks to the chain is actually two loops which seems to me more durable over long-term."

The sound is crystal clear and it's nice to have a little extra in the bag.I use this as a dual-core desktop PC with no issues.  I have the most recent version of Windows 10 on it and it has great performance.  It runs very quiet and seems to be on a high speed.  I have no issues running games or watching Netflix.  The only issue I

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"These function well however they aren't ideal for fixtures where the bulb is visible. The light from these bulbs is concentrated from a small spot in the bulb and as such has an intense, bright light if it isn't covered with a shade or diffuser. Also, the bottom half of the bulb is white plastic. If it's something that bothers you, they don't look great when the bulbs aren't actually on."
Electronics_5,0,"Nice form factor, and well, I guess it does function. Otherwise, it's just absolute junk. Speakers are garbage. Stylus makes every record sound like a 78 played during the Great Depression.

My only concern is the foam inside affecting the bluing on  the gun, so I have wrapped my gun in a silicone cloth. No worries now. Plano has done it again with quality at an affordable price."
Toys_and_Games_5,0,"Expensive, interesting because it magnified cool things, but after a week it sat unused on the floor for months. I wouldn't recommend buying this."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,this worked out great and came in handy I am thinking of buying another one later.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"Quite beautiful! I was very happy to receive this as a gift from my husband (who is terrible at picking out jewelry. this was on the short list that I sent him so he could ""surprise"" me in pre-approved fashion. ) :)) Of course it's lightweight, as some reviewers have noted--a completely solid (filled) 14k gold bracelet would cost a fortune!!!! Most gold jewelry these days is hollow, to reduce cost. For me this is great, because I can't stand heavy jewelry, so this is just like my other Duragold bangles. very light and very comfortable to wear all day long. I've had it for about 3 months now, maybe 4, I wear it almost every day with other jewelry, and see no dents or dings (people who complain about 14k jewelry sustaining dents might want to remember that all 14k jewelry is somewhat soft and prone to dents with heavy or careless use). Additionally, the etching is doing a great job of hiding any scratches it might have sustained. So if you ""play rough"" or regularly tend to, for example, run into walls (??) gold jewelry might not be ideal for you. If you play nice, this is a great bangle, looks very sparkly with the diamond etching, and has a lovely sturdy clasp and a great shape. You won't want to take it off. If you have questions about size, a sizing chart is provided above, and it's very easy to convert millimeters into inches using the Internet. or a ruler. or math. :) 10 mm equals 1 cm. 2. 5 cm equals 1 inch. Public education has not failed us completely."
Electronics_5,0,Just bought a couple more as back ups.  I really like this remote and it works well for what I need it for.  I emailed Audiovox and they confirmed that this is the exact same remote as the RCR314WR but this one costs less.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,Awesome!! Hubby loves it. Great quality! And the rubber one is perfect for when he's working.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,The EVO Stretching Strap with a Screwdriver Washer is a great product for the price.  The other two Stretches I have are the ones that you can't find in most stores.  I have been using this stretching strap for about a year and it has held up great.  I have also tried it on several other stretches I have tried.  I have had great results with it
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"I've only used this a few times, and I like it, but it has some idiosyncrasies.  The sizing is such that it probably fits a man better than a woman.  I""m 5'11"" with a 34 DDD chest and even with all the straps as tight as they can go, it's a little loose on me in places.  The straps run over my breasts which I find a little weird and was probably not intentional, as I think the fit is more for a man.  It's the perfect size storage-wise, fitting all the things I take with me (keys, cell phone, etc).  The pockets on the front are nice to have.  The water bladder is a good size if you won't be out too long.  I have a Camelback that's 2.0 liters I prefer if I'm out longer than an hour or two.  I would recommend it for an average to large man but I don't see how it would properly fit an average size woman.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my review."

Kindle_Store_5,0,"I'm a big fan of Ms. Baeli. I've read all the AKA books and this was my least favorite. ***spoilers***. I particularly found the introduction of the Goth twins a bit unnecessary, but I can see they were necessary to help tie up some loose ends. The abrupt move to Eureka Springs felt just that, abrupt. While Phoebe is the source of all things bountiful, her purchase of the new house and the ease at which the gang made their move seemed forced. Sure, they had to get the heck out of Dodge, but establishing roots somewhere with no real investigation of the new location seemed odd. Three stars does not mean ""bad"" it just means it was an okay read. Nothing will stop me from hoping that there is a book seven as I really want to know what they make of their new home and how Phoebe will resolve her quest for meaning in her life. On a technical note, there were several typos which drive me nuts."

Kindle_Store_5,1,This is an excellent book that will make you feel like you are in the story. I recommend this book. I had a lot of fun with this book. It was very interesting to see what was happening with the two main characters. I would recommend this book. Great series with great characters. I love the way each character had their own story to tell. I will read more of Ms. G. King's books. I enjoyed this book.
Electronics_5,1,"As the owner of a small business, the only thing I can say is that I am not an expert on software. The software is solid and works well. I'm a professional and have used many computers in the past. I am very pleased with the price and the quality of the products. I would recommend this to anyone who has a computer. I bought these for my husband's older one. He had to use them for a few hours and they didn't work very well. He uses them for his music and the sound quality is really good. This is a great case for a DSLR. It is easy to put on, holds the camera securely, and is very durable. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a case for a DSLR. This is a great product!  I have used it for almost a month now and it works well. It was very easy to install and the cable is very durable. It has a lot of features and looks very nice. I am happy with it. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a case for a DSLR."

Pet_Supplies_5,1,1st :. my cat's like this. It's a good price. My dog loves this treat. I bought this for a friend who has a small dog and she had a very sensitive ear. She had her ears fixed and I was able to remove the ear plug to get her ears back. I used this with a toothbrush and she had a very sensitive ear. After I got it I was able to remove the ear plug and her ears were no longer sensitive. I am very pleased with this product.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,I have a 1500W oil lamp with the bulb on it. I need a 40W one. I am using the 18W bulb and am using a 75W one. The bulb is a little smaller than the 18W one. I have to replace the bulb every 5-10 years. I did get a 60W one from Amazon for $250. 00 and I will buy another for $50. 00. I have a 60W one for $2. 00 and a 75W one for $2. 50. I will be buying a 75W one and a 75W one for $2. 50. I bought a bulb from a local vendor and now I have to replace them every 5-10 years. This is a great lamp and a great price. I have no complaints about this lamp. I have a few other reviews that have the same problem. I have read a lot of reviews that mention how small the bulb is. I have been using it for about a month and it seems to be working great. I am now buying another bulb for $3. 50. I would have to order another bulb if I had a problem with it. I am now ordering another bulb. I hope it works great. This is a good product. I am very happy with the quality of the product. I use it for several projects and it is good quality. I have had it for about a month now and it is very good.
Pet_Supplies_5,0,Great product. Our german shepherd loves them. Most importantly the squeak. They also hold up very well going through the clothes washer.

It holds a lot more than one might think and it sits tight underneath the seat without any hanging or interference with the back tire at all. I would buy again if the quality is the same."

I recommend it to anyone who enjoys anime, anime, and anime-related movies.I love this series. It has all the elements of a good thriller, but with a twist.  The characters are very believable, and the plot is believable.  I'm not sure why the producers didn't include a scene where the real killer is at the end of the movie.

I think it's going to be a great tire for touring this summer.  It's really built to take a beating.  I'm running XLC Thorn resistant tubes, which are also very think and tough.  The only downside I see is that this setup is very heavy, which might turn some people off.  However, I'd rather go a little slower and not have to stop and fix flats.  I think this tire/tube combo will become my new favorite, especially when touring and carrying weight on the back of the bike.  I've had a Schwallbe Marathon on the front for four tears and never had a flat.  Bottom line:  It's a great tire that is built for punishment and extreme conditions."

Julian was adorable. I loved him from the start and really connected with him. Morgan was adorable too and so normal.

Kindle_Store_5,0,"What a great story. This story was not just about the zombie apocalpse but was a metaphor for what will happen when we allow too much of the government to interfere by accepting the mark of the beast. It also shows what will hapen when the government no longer cares or is invloved in our lives the way we need them to. What happens when we are truly left alone. There are several verses from the bible sprinkled through the book. Each chapter giving us a lesson. Each lesson hidden well enough as to not interfere with the story or turn you off. Eventhough the author uses the bible and speak to a lot of Christian values, this is a book that anyone could grasp and enjoy. I give this book 5 stars."

The gray color is gorgeous, really brings out the buckle and strap detail.  They're very comfortable, and I love the height - so many boots are either too low or too high.  The ankle is loose enough that I can tuck skinny jeans into them.  I'm a true size 5, and they're true to size, maybe verging toward a tiny bit snug in the toe box, but I'm going to keep them.

Toys_and_Games_5,0,"We had a similar experience that someone else expressed - we have the the Maisto Desert Rebel 1967 Ford Mustang GT Radio Control Vehicle (1:10 Scale) and the Maisto Desert Rebel Volkswagen Beetle Radio Control Vehicle (1:10 Scale). Both of our vehicles came in the 49 Mhz frequency which makes them hard to use together which can be a problem since I have two sons who want to play together. It came be a bit frustrating because they want to play with their cars at the same time but at 9 and 11 years old, they overcome the issue be just staying apart enough distance so it isn't a problem.

The Mustang is super cool and the kids (and Dad) thought this one was the coolest. Weve always had sort of hit or miss results with R/C vehicles and this one has been slightly better than average for us.

Movies_and_TV_5,0,"I still can't get over what a 'find' this film was.  I've never been to New Zealand, and the beautiful cities and seascapes alone were enough to give this film five stars!  The story line was educational.  I later did some research to better understand the Moari people.  That info would have been helpful before watching the film actually.  That added layer of obligation, and duty to his sense of origin would have made some parts of the movie easier to track.  While they did offer us some subtitles during more intimate tribal converstaions there were still words used that made no sense to a yankee like me.  The other thing I enjoy about foreign films is that they don't always tie everything up in a beautiful Tiffany box and bow.  This movie is no exception.  Life doesn't resolve itself in 2 hours.  The movie challenged it's viewers to think about life choices, desires, and the realtiies of following your heart."

The story follows a couple who find themselves in the middle of a dangerous and dangerous situation. While in a very dangerous situation, they both have issues to work on. The characters are well developed and the storyline is full of action. The author does a great job of bringing the characters together and making the situation interesting.

This book is about two young people who find their way into one another's lives and have to find out what is going on. The story is fast paced and the characters are well developed. There is a lot of action and mystery that is well-developed. There is also a lot of romance and some action. The story is well written and the characters are well developed. I highly recommend it.This is a good story with"

Books_5,0,"This excellent novel explores the tensions between the sexes in the 1800s. Though no one who reads Atwood should be surprised by her orderly, logical, deeply considered characterization, Grace Marks is a new high in Atwood's repetoire. Atwood's word play also flits around the book, and riffs on certain terms reflect and reverberate with studied meaning. I won't spoil it any more for you. It's an excellent book.

Books_5,0,"While not Feist's best writing, it wasn't his worst either. Feist may not be the most eloquent writer on earth, but in my opinion, he is one of the most intriguing. Prince Arutha and his brothers are heros, and while I wish Feist had written more books about Arutha's exploits, I enjoyed reading about the coming of age of his sons. Erland and Borric, the king's spoiled brats, are sent as ambassadors to the country of Great Kesh mainly to teach them a lesson -- grow up! As usual, things go very wrong and the boys are separated, and then they find themselves fighting for their lives. In Prince of the Blood, Feist introduces Nakor, a new character of questionable character in the series, and with his help, Arutha's sons come out all grown up and smelling like a rose. Not to spoil it by mentioning names, but one character I loved loses his life in Kesh. Feist certainly is good about killing off characters when they've reached a dead end -- and sometimes before I am ready to say goodbye."

My biggest complaint is that the crayons ""shorten"" rather quickly so...as they shorten, the harder it is for little and big fingers to get out. It used to frustrate her so I stopped letting her use them. Now she uses the Dorothy fish bowl as a fun water strainer. Elmo is great too, he dries quickly, overnite and he is good to use as a learning tool for the young bather."
Books_5,1,"First of all, let me point out that the movie is not a science fiction story. It is a story about the crew of the USS Berenstain Bears, a sub-class of the ship that is currently in the process of being refitted for the USS Voyager. The story is about the crew of the Berenstain Bears, a group of humans who are traveling to a distant planet to see a spacecraft that is on a mission to a star in the constellation Leo. The crew is lost, and the crew members are sent back to Earth to be re-united with their fellow crew members. A couple of days later, the crewmembers get back together and the crew members are sent back to Earth to find out why the crew members were lost."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"While the price is nice, the shipping was not. Combined, I would have liked a slightly heavier duty bag. While making kefir cheese, after pouring everything into the bag, I twisted the bag to form a ball and then applied slight pressure to help expedite the draining of whey. I was surprised to see some of the curd squeeze through the weave. Perhaps it was because I did not wait until the separation had occurred and the curd had become more dense.

I was hesitant to put much pressure on the bag after that, even after it had hung for about a half hour, but it is probably a good thing as I might have been even more aggressive and ruined the bag. This is far nicer than any cheesecloth you could buy, but I suggest being gentle with it.

I am certain that depending on what this is used for, you'll get different results. For Kefir, I think it was faster leaving it in a bowl, pouring off the liquid and repeating.

At the end of the day, I am glad I have this bag and would recommend it."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"I was actually hoping to find something about half this size with the same purpose.  If I could find a wine rack that held 12 bottles and 8 glasses that would fit on my counter top, I would be ecstatic.  Unfortunately, I couldn't find anything like that.  And the two part accessories that provided that functionality would end up costing twice as much as this unit.  So after several weeks of debating and shopping, I finally decided on this one.  And I'm pretty happy.

First of all, it just looks awesome in the corner of my kitchen.  Plus, the extra counter top is a definite plus.  It is also very easy to put together.  It took me longer to get it out of the package than it actually took me to assemble.  But the biggest bonus is just how awesome it looks.  I can't emphasize that enough.

A few other reviews mentioned that it didn't hold many of the larger base wine glasses.  I utilize two different types of glasses, a rounded goblet for red wine and a taller glass for white wine (I don't drink sparkling wine...blech).  Both generic types of glasses fit perfectly.

My only complaint with this item is the fact that the legs were not perfectly alligned at first assembly.  If I had placed it on carpet, I would have never even noticed.  But it was on a flat, tile surface.  It wobbled just a little bit.  I suspected that this was the result of the torque put on the screws during assembly.  So I loosened all of the screws on the sides and then retightened them.  Problem solved."
Kindle_Store_5,0,"I started out excitedly reading this novel but soon lost interest.  In fact, it took me several months to finally finish it.  I felt the author treated the main characters like cardboard cutouts:  there was no real life to them and they acted very stereotypically.  Also, I thought that the plot would jerk forward at times leaving out important details.  Finally, the plot seemed too far-fetched to have happened in the deep south.  Would a plantation owner's daughter really have been a slave runner and married a Native American man?  And after William killed Thomas with an arrow I do not think that he would have remained alive.  Other plantation owners would have hunted him down and killed him in real life, I believe."

I really like how the lid snaps and secures to the crockpot itself. The lid and and insert casserole bowl are dish washer safe and I have put both on the bottom rack. I recommend washing in the dishwasher to help get those hard smells out of the lid and bowl like curries, chilis, meatball marinaras, and stews.

After he destroyed the first ball after chewing on it for 15 minutes, he has learned to be more gentle of his chewing with them (Note: these balls are tougher then a regular tennis ball, with the added bonus of a squeaky noise when chewed on or squeezed.)

Toys_and_Games_5,0,"Puzzles used to be something we did during our vacations at the ocean.  We liked to go in the off season to watch the storms and we'd always have a puzzle to work on.  When I received the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vintage-Vacations-2000-Piece-Puzzle/dp/B006ROJPD6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vintage Vacations 2000 Piece Puzzle</a>&nbsp;it brought back memories of these vacations and I was excited to start the puzzle.

First I had to find an open surface that was large enough for the puzzle.  I had hoped our card table would work, but it was too small.  I ended up putting it onto our kitchen table for the time being. As the description states it's 38.5"" x 29.5"", so not a small puzzle by any means.

Upon opening the box I was impressed that all of the pieces were contained in a plastic bag. When I cut it open and dumped them it to the box, I could see the quality of the pieces. These are very solid pieces, that do not bend easily and the edges were clean.

My daughter and I started putting it together the best way we know how, by doing the border first. This meant sorting through 2000 pieces, but it really makes it easier to start.  Once we had the border done we sorted the pieces by color and that is one of the things I really enjoyed about this puzzle. The colors were great! Vibrant, glossy and the different areas were pretty distinguishable.  Within a day we were at least a 1/4 done, two days later it was 1/2 done and by day four it was complete.

I think what I enjoyed most about this puzzle was the time spent sitting with my 18 year old daughter who is so busy these days, that we rarely see each other. She was so interested in it, that I would find her doing it at all hours.

Overall I was impressed with this Ravensburger puzzle and I'd recommend this one or any of their many others. They are great for your family and nice enough for gift giving too."

What a great surprise for him to confront her about it. Too funny! I definitely want MORE, MORE, and MORE! I love the authors ability to keep you completely entertained, surprised by the characters' actions, and not ruining the book by repetitive previous statements trying to keep you in the loop! I very much dislike when authors keep referring to past events like you haven't been reading the book for months and suddenly pick it back up to read. None of that here! Get the book.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Firstly these are great quality sockets,  the only draw back about the set is the case.  The sockets sit in kinda of a shallow valley when in the case, each has their place but if you are jar the case they can fall out of the case kinda easy.  Also the hinge of the case is a living hinge, meaning the hinge is just really bending plastic back and forth, without a hinge like a door hinge so to speak it really makes the case very suspect-able to wearing out as you bend the plastic to open the case and then have to bend the plastic back to the closing position. The sockets are great, the customer service associated with the TEXTON tool brand is excellent, but the case itself could have better design for longevity and sockets keeping where they should stay as you move the case with the door in the open position.  But for the price you really can't get a more better set for the price."

The rubber treads do improve the grip on the ball tremendously.  My six year old nephew prefers using this ball over his old orange basketball.  The only problem is that the ball is black and we live in Florida.  The ball collects heat fairly quickly and if the ball is left out, forget about playing with it.  Too bad they couldn't make this ball in the typical orange rubber so that it wouldn't get so hot in the heat.  Other than the color and how hot it gets in the sun it is a very good basketball."

Kindle_Store_5,0,"This is a second novel I've read from Colleen Collins, and again she delivers with a 'big bang'. The hero is an attorney, heroine a private eye. At one time, she was his law firm's private investigator, but after stepping into the legal-gray-area one too many times, he put her on probation with a stern warning that one more slip-up, she's out. What he doesn't know is that her ""questionable"" investigation uncovered a growing sinkhole in his personal life, one that could destroy his world...something he learns too late. And then what is the next right thing to do? A question both of them face.
Suspense and right ingredients of the romance pushes this well written novel to the top of my list of the titles at the moment. Highly recommended."

Movies_and_TV_5,0,"I am a big Beatles fan but always had mixed feelings about John. He was obviously a great musician and showman. His Imagine album is wonderful, and his plea for peace in the title song is downright anthemic for the peace movement. He truly believed in love; his favorite lyric was ""All you need is love."" At the same time, for much of his life he was often nastily sarcastic, hotheaded, and abusive, especially when drinking. My understanding of his boyhood before I saw this film was that Lennon liked to exaggerate how difficult his situation had been, separated from his mother and raised by his Aunt Mimi, when in reality he had a very comfortable, secure, middle-class upbringing. I continued to hold this view throughout the film, thinking how good he had it: a reunion with a mother who was fun, doting, and indulgent while being watched over by a strict, but loving, aunt. That is, until the moment when Mimi revealed to him exactly the circumstances of the loss of his father and separation from his mother. Then I got it. And when he finally lost his mother for good, I can see why he described his growing up years as hard. I have much more sympathy for him now."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"Ordered these from Amazon but there was problem with 1-day shipping. Ended up getting them from Peter Glenn, as I needed them in time for a trip. But after experiencing them, I just had to come leave a review. I mostly wear Merino Wool dress socks, as my wardrobe is primarily comprised of suits. However, when I do wear sneakers, I solely wear Viscose socks made from Bamboo, which has a softness similar to or surpassing cashmere socks (depending on the brand), and have become quite spoiled by them. I was looking for a nice pair of Bamboo no-show socks, and I encountered this brand on Amazon. Eye-brow raised, because it had the best of both worlds in the composition (Merino Wool + Bamboo). So I ordered the Ultra-light version, and was surprisingly disappointed because that version was abrasive / scratchy; not soft at all. But there were so many great reviews on these socks, and I noticed there was a thicker version (Ultra-Light versus Light Cushion), so I decided to experiment and give them a try as I thought the thicker version might be softer. Well, I'm glad that I did, because these socks feel great. The feel is very comparable to Cariloha bamboo socks, which is the best pure bamboo viscose brand I've encountered and I've tried tonnes of brands. I'm glad that I tried this brand as Cariloha socks although there is a low cut version, they are not compression socks. Feetures! has the cashmere range level of softness, with the compressive benefits making it the all around best sports sock I've tried. I highly recommend it. My only complaints are that, first the socks are not truly ""no-show"" socks. It's very easy to see the socks, but I like that it doesn't cover my ankles. The other thing is the branding. I would've prefered more subtle branding, perhaps only a symbol / logo, but that's a personal style thing. It does not inhibit nor take away from the experience of the sock."

I wanted to be able to see the relationship between the two main characters. I wanted to know what happened to the heroine. I wanted to see what happened to the man that was the hero of the story.

And the special effects are quite stunning. The best part about this movie is how the entire movie is shot in a time and place that is completely different from the world you've seen in your lifetime. It's amazing to me that movies like this can be released at such a great price. I highly recommend this movie.I thought this was going to be one of the best shows ever made.  The acting was superb, the direction was perfect, and the production value was amazing.  I found it hard to believe that the producers of this show would only release a series of 10 or so episodes with all the special features.  I hope that they will do a second season of this series, but I have not seen the second season of this show.  I hope that they will try and continue the series with other shows.  However, I think that these series would be much better if they were more like ""The Avengers.""  The first season was a bit more interesting, but it was a little more of a mystery.  The second season was a bit more realistic, but I think that the special features were better.  I think that the producers of the show should be able to make more episodes with more episodes, but I think that the series could have been better.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"These motion night lights are the best.

I'm not the one that likes lights running at night, I like it dark to sleep and even a nightlight in the bathroom glowing is too much light for me.  I installed at first one of these in the bathroom and loved it so much I had to buy more packs so we could put one in the kitchen, on the basement stairs, laundry room, and additional bathroom.

The light turns on only when you need it, when your in the room.  The light is plenty bright to see what you are doing in the bathroom (not for reading though) but not too bright to wake you totally up at night.  It turns on and runs for about 45 seconds unless additional motion is detected.

I find myself leaving the lights off when I go into the basement as the motion nightlight is plenty bright enough for me to sagely climb the stairs or walk in the basement without fear of tripping over the pet.

I had some relatives over and one of them commented on the nightlight so much that I ended up giving her one for her own home.  She afterwards commented how much she loved having it.  Simple devices make life so much easier...

PROS:
- Low Voltage LED
- Uses very little power
- Will illuminate a 10x8 bathroom no problem (not a reading brightness though)
- Only on when you want it on
- Bright enough to see what you are doing without waking you up too badly at night
- You'd better buy the multi-pack or you'll be buying again
- Runs for about 45 seconds unless more motion detected
- Have been using now for about 2 years without a failure

CONS:
- Wish I had found these a long time ago (I hated the 7watt nightlights)
- Cat runs by it to see in her litter box (I though they could see well in the dark)"

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"Its easy to put together. No more hard water, flouride, etc. Im using one filter at the moment. I do not plan on using it in river waters, lakes, etc. since the filters are $89-$99 a pop, unless I have to.  The filters are ten dollars cheaper at Infowars. I will use it in a camping situation. If I should have to use it in a emergency situation and filter outside waters in it, Ill update.

The instructions say to flush the system out twice before using, in which I did. It takes awhile for the water to pass through the filter.

The water is silky almost like drinking distilled water.  There no smells or odd tastes. I drink a lot of water & its nice to drink from a stainless steel tank rather than a plastic Brita or plastic jug, even if it claims to be BPH free.

Instead of using my refrigerators ice cubes, I make my own from the AlexaPure Pro. The ice cubes are clearer and theres no more particles floating in my drinks after the ice melts.

I shouldve bought this a few years ago.

After a few months I took it apart & rinsed it out. A few weeks ago I looked at it & red rust looking marks occurred at the bottom of the top tank which sits in the bottom tank. They were set into 4-5 scratch lines and I though it was rust & I didn't want to use any abrasive on it to make sure. At 1st I thought this thing isn't made of stainless. I called My Patriot Supply & it turned out to be bacteria. Now I will use soap & water with a light scrub pad once a month to clean the inside surfaces as instructed by the person at MPS as it did take away the red bacteria."

The only downside is that the rangefinder is not as accurate as the Canon T3i.  This is because the zoom lens is in the camera, and it's not very sharp.  The zoom lens is a bit too wide, and it's not very sharp.  I think the Sony lens will make a great lens for portraits, but it won't do much with a camera.  The camera is very small, and I'd be happy with it if it had a wider rangefinder.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"I love earth shoes, i own a few and have purchased them since the 70's. I ordered this sneaker style despite the reviews by some that was less than favorable. They arrived fast, is of a decent quality however, the back of the shoe defies logic. the designer of this shoe should have worn them and then modified them accordingly. The shoe has a very hard ish plastic piece of material that for reasons known only to the designer of this shoe that jute's up past the rim of the sneaker to rub painfully into the back of your calf. this is why, i stated you can wear it for an hour or less but and a big but...if, you have a high tolerance to pain. this is the only area of this shoe that is vastly lacking in foresight and a flaw in its otherwise excellent design. i decided to modify my shoes myself and keep them because they are cute and of course, an earth shoe but seriously, designer!!! modify your design. i might not be so forgiving or tolerant of a poor design flaw where if extra thought were given, as in, the prototype had been worn by the designer, they would have very quickly realized the flaw and modified before mass production and because, this is not to be expected of an earth shoe brand, in other words, it shouldn't exist. i have purchased an arch insert to boost up the arch as I have a high arch and needed extra support, since its a lace up shoe, it has a very generous room for your toes. i ordered a 9 women size which, is a size larger than I normally wear so i would have more room for the fall and winter months when i wear boot socks."

Talk about the sexy banter between Amber and Lance...so, good!  Lance mouth was just so deliciously sexy, off the chain.  Amber says ""You're not coming over"" Lance says ""I will be there and we both will be coming later""......Daym that was Hot!!  He can sneak in my bedroom at my parents house anytime!  The character development was really good, nice little twist in there.....I TOTALLY LOVED IT!  Lance became my favorite when I read ""Mate for Gideon""...He called Sarah, Prim (Ms. Prim & Proper), next to my boy Zane..I mean vamp..Love Zane!  Talk about eating humble pie...I  don't want to give anything away but when I read about the door slamming in the face, I thought that was the ultimate.  Ah mannnn, I died laughing, it was GREAT!  KARMA is something!  I loved the fact that Charlene brought back previous mates, I wish there was a bit more conversation, but it was cool.  Brant, Zane, lil Sam and Tanya...Tanya still holding off on sex to get her way??  She's something.  I totally hope Charlene give us story on the Elf Prince..who was the vamp he fell in love with, Brant's secretary?? I'm dying to find out!  Can't wait for Titan to get a mate. He's all messed up, want to read more about that species relations thing, hope there's a shifter females and vamp hook-up, witches were mentioned and did they say dragon shifters....Whoaaaa!  Looking forward to reading that....Keep these fun stories coming Charlene, they're great!"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,"I bought this being a gift for my daughter and she loved it.  It's been a great gift and we are happy with it.  The box was packaged in a very large package with a small box of packing tape on it.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great gift.  I love the color and the size.  It is a great quality product.  I would buy it again.  I am very happy with it.This is a great product for the price. It works well, but I wish it was more sturdy"

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"I live in the North where the heat being on all wither can just dry you out.  With the installation of this that I had done professionally, we have a much better humidity ratio in the house.  I no longer wake up with a bloody nose or dry eyes.  My furniture is also happier!!  It cost me less thatn $350 with the installation as opposed to my neighbor who had a humidifier installed in his home for $1000.  It could be installed by a DIYer if they are moderate to professionally good at these things.  I was scared to try and got a decent price from the plumber to do it so saved myself some time, effort and cursing."
Toys_and_Games_5,0,"My daughter - 2.5 years old - loves new toys and is usually a big fan of ones that interact with her.  She was not terribly impressed with this doll and neither was I.  The biggest feature of this doll is supposed to be that it giggles and laughs when you bounce and spin her.  In reality, you have to get very forceful (borderline abusive) in order to get her to ""react.""  I was concerned by the level of force my toddler needed to use to get a reaction, and I did not in any way want to encourage that level of forceful activity with her toys, especially considering that we are adding a new baby to the family soon.

Baby Alive went to the back of the closet and there have been no requests for her return as of yet.  We will probably simply remove her batteries and reintroduce her as ""just"" a cuddly baby doll."

The movie is a very good movie.  The only thing I would change is to order it from Amazon.  I am glad I did.I love this movie.  I have watched it many times.  I like that the actors are better than the director.  I hope the director has a better script.This is a great movie.  It has a lot of action, great story, and it is not as big as a horror movie.  I would recommend this movie to any horror fan.  Great movie for a good price.  My 3 year old loves it.  I hope I can get another one in the future.My 2 year old loves this show!

Kindle_Store_5,0,"Love Belvin has quickly earned a spot on my list of favorite authors. I can safely say I will read whatever she put out.

I think I might have been frustrated by the series if I read it as it was released, because each of the first books stopped very abruptly. Luckily, I didn't get put onto these books until all four were released.

I also must applaud the author of providing quality length novels. These were no novellas.

As for the actual content and presentation. Literally the only odd thing was the use of random thesaurus words that don't show up with frequency in the English language. I could guess their meanings from context clues, but I did find myself looking up a few definitions in each book.

The characterization of the main and support characters, and the development of the plot was flawless! The character's had enough of a history for them to be real, and they went through the right amount of hardships in moving toward commitment. She beautifully crafted an alpha warrior, while also allowing him to have a certain level of love and adoration of his woman. The way the characters grew to know themselves was wonderful to watch and resonated with the reader.

Well worth the read."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Very modern looking and works well for small bathroom.  The sound of the fan is not bad.  Sure you can hear it is running, but it is not obnoxious noise.  I was painting the ceiling on a very cold windy day and there was no cold air blowing back into the bathroom."
Movies_and_TV_5,0,"It's hard to classify this movie. I guess it's a ""drama"", but nothing particularly dramatic happens. Mainly it's a chance to watch the interplay of personalities, mainly between the father and the two brothers.
Oh, and there's some really pretty scenery and some fancy fishing.
To enjoy this movie, you have to be prepared to sit back, relax, and be receptive to a slow unfolding of the story's subleties. A little bit like the way people enjoy fishing, come to think of it.
The DVD version is great for maximizing the scenic aspect of the movie - this really requires the wide-screen format. Not too much in the way of bonus materials, though."

Toys_and_Games_5,0,"My youngest daughter, my niece and their friends are all into Monster High dolls, so this was a very welcome addition to the collection.  The playset is huge!  Even though the box was somewhat large, I was still surprised by the size of the finished product.  Speaking of which, it requires some relatively minor assembly.  Once assembled, it can either be used as a play toy or a large themed display case for over a dozen dolls for the types who are more into collecting the dolls rather than playing with them.  My oldest daughter collected Bratz years ago and still has them preserved in their fancy custom themed storage cases to this day.  She rarely actually played with them.  On the other hand, my youngest daughter and my niece are more into playing with their dolls than collecting, so this playset sees a lot of action.  It can also be used for both purposes.  It's durable enough to withstand hours of regular play and the dolls can be stored inside on decorative display when not in use.  The playhouse is somewhat sturdy but can be a little shaky at times and has several moveable parts, some of which seem like they may be easily broken if your child is a little too rough.  Speaking of dolls, none are included with the playset.  I ordered two new dolls so I could present them along with the playset.  It just seemed more exciting to surprise her with the playset along with new dolls instead of just the playset alone.  The girls absolutely love it so far.  It's definitely a worthwhile pickup if you have a young girl who plays with or collects Monster High dolls.  Just make sure there is plenty of room for storage and play, because  like I said... It's huge."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Beautiful well-fitting faucet with well constructed hardware that operates smoothly.

First of all, you'll need a baseplate for most installations as the faucet does not come with one. This one:
Hansgrohe 14019001 Baseplate Kitchen Fits All, 10 Inch, Chrome
fits perfectly and the chrome matches the faucet. It costs around $40.

Next, the instructions are not particularly helpful for the non-plumbers among us. We hired a plumber for the installation. He was able to complete the task in about 80 minutes and charged $85. Note that if you have a separate spray attachment on your sink, you'll need to remove that and cap the hole.

The faucet has a switch on the top to go from smooth flow to spray, and the end of the faucet can be pulled out so that you can fill pots that are beside the sink using full flow. This is a significant feature.

This is not a small faucet, and it's just a little too tall for a small kitchen with a standard sized double sink. However, while it might look a little disproportionate, this improves the convenience factor since there will never be the possibility of something not fitting under the faucet and into the sink. It's a great faucet for larger sized sinks.

The handle works well to adjust both flow rate and temperature. Note that the faucet favors the right-handed person due to the position of the handle. No leaks, drips, or other annoyances. In use, the faucet is quiet. I'm very happy with the end result."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Good price point and some nice color options.  Use to change the colors on the front of the house as the seasons change.  Green for St. Patrick's Day, Red for Valentines Day etc.  And being LED not so bad on the electric bill.  First one lasted me a few years."
Toys_and_Games_5,1,"My two sons love k'nex and this is an excellent addition.  We also have the Clue.  There are a few different versions.  The basic game is pretty simple, but that's part of it.  The game itself is fun.  I don't know how many people have played it without a game to keep them interested.  The kids love to play with the game and just pretend to play.  I think that's important.  It's very simple to play and very easy to learn.  The kids will really enjoy playing with it.  I'm very happy with it and am glad that it's included in the package.This is a great game, but I like that it does not take up too much room in the board. I think it is a good starter game for younger kids. However, the board is too small. The pieces are too small, so the pieces fall out easily.

I was very pleasantly surprised with how nice the quality was!! I would definitely buy it again.

I would compare its texture and quality to that of the standard 3m brand tape you can find at lowes or Home Depot, but this is sooooo much cheaper."

You have a lot of options to control the sensitivity and the features are easy to use.  The app is VERY intuitive and easy to figure out.  I tell everyone about mine!

My favorite part is the HEIGHT at which they are installed. Because they are lights - they are installed higher which gives you a better angle for faces.  The Ring system is typically LOW and I didn't like the angles."

It was a fun movie. The special effects were excellent. The cinematography was superb. The music was very good. I loved the characters. They were so funny and loved it.

It is not only filled with gorgeous photos of the cast and Highclere Castle, the setting for the story, but it also contains interesting and informative back-story about the era of ""Downton Abbey"".  Subjects range from fashion, life in service, family life, and romance to houses and estates and World War 1.  It's the definitive companion book to the series and something to tide you over during the long wait for Series 3!!"

Toys_and_Games_5,0,"This is just like the V911 and V912 helos.  But bigger.  Significantly bigger.

Lots of purists hate this helicopter. They say its like driving a school bus. EXACTLY. If you're looking for a tiny agile helo to do cool tricks this isn't it. If you're looking for a big-boned helo that sounds awesome, that you can feel the wind from, that you can shred your trees and frighten your animals this is it. You can fly this thing very high and a long way away since you can still sight it due to its size.

Do not get this as your first helo. You need to know how to fly a V911 or V912 size first. This could seriously damage something (or someone) in your yard. Also, while this helo can take a reasonable beating, you'll damage it pretty quick if you don't know how to fly it. Heavier weight equals more damage. Also, you'll probably lose a helo in a tree (well, I've placed about 15 -- fortunately 14 were retrievable with a 20' ladder and a 40' fiberglass pole). Lose a significantly cheaper one than this."

Movies_and_TV_5,0,"I ordered the season and watched every episode back to back as soon as it became available. Epic! This season parts company from the books because there are no more novels at present, so purists will find a lot to dislike about this season. On the other hand, it is great TV with some fantastic acting by all of the male leads. Kit Harrington, Liam Cunningham and Stephen Dillane are powerful all the way through, and Tyrion and Sir Jorah are a delight as always. Great work from Jonathan Pryce as the High Sparrow.
As for the women, Arya and Brienne continue to surprise and delight, and Sansa gets a bit less like a wet noodle.  Circe is up to her usual tricks but as Bronn says, evil has a tendency to turn back on itself. Margery and her gran, the amazing Diana Rigg, rounded things out pretty nicely. Not much movement from Queen Dany but we are left with all sorts of interesting possibilities in the final episode.
There are a lot of unanswered questions at the end of Episode 10 and throughout the whole season with respect to Bran, and for the past 2 seasons with regard to Rickon and the wilding woman who was supposed to find somewhere safe for him. Episode 8 shows there is nowhere safe from the Whitewalkers.  Great special effects and settings round off an excellent season, not perfect, but certainly better than most things on TV these days. With any luck, there will be many more seasons to come."
Electronics_5,0,"I bought this case from a store for my new iPad (3rd gen). While it does fit, it would slip out of the smaller clips on the left side of the case that hold the device every once in awhile. Finally, after having it for only 4 days, one of the clips snapped. So, needless to say I'm looking for a new case...

Here's what I liked about the case:
 - Very thin, and didn't add much bulkiness to the device
 - Nice thick cover with soft inside, made me feel that the screen would be protected.
 - The faux-leather cover dosen't look too ""fake""

What I didn't like:
 - The band that is made to hold the device closed. I stopped using it after the first day. Don't they know that this will just break off? Plus, the cover stays closed well on it's own.
 - The small clips that hold the iPad in the case on the left side. I couldn't understand why they couldn't use a longer band to hold the device in like the right side."

I installed it in my bathroom to control the exhaust fan and it works perfectly.  You need to know what you're doing in the junction box because all 4 wires need to be hooked up correctly (and there -must- be a white wire for power,) but it was not difficult and it looks nice along side the other switches."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"Funny, I just sold a Bulova Precisionist chronograph (9B175) this past week, and then ended up getting this one!  The other Bulova was a bit too large, heavy, and chunky for my tastes.  This one, however, is very nicely done!!

I have a large watch collection, including many dive watches - some at price points between $1K-2K.  Still, I am very impressed with what Bulova has done with this 300m Sea King!  The dial is simple, extremely legible, and beautiful.  The orange highlights look great against the black dial.  And the smooth sweeping second hand is a cool sight to behold.  It is smoother than the second hand on virtually any automatic watch.  The top of the bezel is brushed, and looks REALLY nice.  It has a usable lume pip at the 12:00 position, and the dial lume is pretty good also.  The rest of the case has brushed and polished bits, making for a very nice overall look.  The case is relatively large, at about 49mm diameter (not including crown).  Even the rubber strap is pretty nice for a $200 watch!  The case back even has a cool little logo on it.

The accuracy of these Bulova 262kHz watches is superb!!  You will only find equal or better accuracy in watches that are radio or satellite controlled - and many of those are much more expensive than this one.

All in all, this is a fine watch for $200+ dollars!!  I'm happy to add it to my collection."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"I installed this faucet on my garage sink because of its constant use and the profile of the vertical position of the filter.  Installation is a snap and simple.  I did it with no problem and that's a bundle to say.  I waited this long to be sure the filter worked and the unit had the longevity that I expected and with each issue the unit is flawless.  My water comes directly out of the ground in the back yard, goes through about 400 feet of pumping and then another 200 feet of pipe to get it into the house before it goes into the water holder.  Whew, what a trip.  No wonder it takes rainwater over 6 months to seep down to the water level.  After the water comes into the holding system it is then sent into the house pipes upon demand.  It goes through a wound cord filter and then a charcoal filter before it finds its way to the PUR-3.  I know that's a long route and story but I wanted to be sure I gave the facts as best I could.  The PUR-3 did it's job.  It provided me with as clean a water as I could ask for.  No, it is not distilled water but it is close.  I checked it for obvious solids and other discolorations and it was as clean as I could expect because I found not the first foreign item.

I considered giving this a 5 star and did not because the amount of water coming out the faucet is significantly less than the water coming out of an unfiltered tap.  That reduced my use of the faucet from time to time such as washing the dogs or preparing water for use in cleaning paint brushes.  Removal and remounting the faucet is as easy as can be and is not an issue.  I recommend this unit without any exception and the water flow is more my problem then that of PUR.  Good drinking."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,The lights were fairly easy to install and the materials are good.  The light is bright and the light output is very bright.  I also like the fact that the light output is adjustable.  I have been using this in a multi-room house with 4 bedrooms.  The light output is about 8 watts.  I also like the fact that it is a single color.  I just installed it with the wire stripper and it works great.  I would recommend this light for any home or work where the color temperature is desired.  I would also recommend this light for a small work area where it is useful for some decorative purposes.  I have bought a lot of different types of lights and this one does the job perfectly.  I have a large cabinet with a variety of LED's and this one is very useful for any of those areas.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"This really isn't even the same tool as the 2-ton cable puller.  I mean it is, but this thing is MASSIVE.  It weighs about 35 pounds and looks able to pull a house over.  The thing is so big it's almost difficult to work with.  You need to be rather strong to get it moved around set up even before you begin cranking.

This is very well made, of exceptional quality, and amazingly strong.  Made right here in the good old USA.  You can buy this thing, use the tar out of it, and give it to your grown child someday and he can then give it to his kid some day.  Really, it's that well made.

Electronics_5,0,"Great USB cable.  I tested power transfer and there were no concerns there.  6 feet cables are my new best friend - they make life more manageable when charging your phone/laptop/tablet - 3 feet is an odd length really.

This cable comes packaged in a small bag plastic bag - great for personal use, not gift presentation worthy in my opinion though.

Overall, a great 6 foot cable - seems solid, I expect it to last for quite awhile.

Pros: it works, good power transfer, solid connections - minorly snug, so I don't think they'll start falling out of plugs anytime soon.

Cons: none that I can think of.

I received a free product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"This is a light weight suit.  It looked very nice on my 15 year old son when he gave a presentation.  It is nicely tailored.  It looks more expensive than it is because of the tailoring.  I hemmed it myself pretty easily by folding it inside out and sewing up the side seams enough to hold it in place.  He had no problems with it slipping and it looked professional. Usually I use Dritz stitch witchery iron on hem, which I love,  but I couldn't find it at the last minute."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"While Case intends their knives to be pocketknives, they have the quality and look of a fine collectable. The Stockman model gives you 3 good blades of varying size and shape.  The large version weighs an ounce and a half more than the medium size and is 5/8 of an inch longer.  The additional size and weight can pull your pocket out of shape.  The amber bone  has an excellent hand feel and is a joy to hold. The blades are very sharp. Stainless steel will require less care to keep rust away but still hold a good edge.
A Case knife is a possession to be treasured that will be with you for years. Case is an investment in a quality knife that will become a life-long friend.  In a world of cheaply made knives from overseas, American made Case is a beacon of quality. For over one hundred years, this company produced quality knives. This knife will sharpened to a fine edge for years and will hold that edge under repeated usage."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"This is a very preliminary review. I'm a little miffed that I'm even writing it. Nest/Google survey ""encouraged"" me to come here and do it even though my protects have only been installed for about 2 days. I normally would just ignore their desires and do this on my own time but it's annoying enough to share with you. First, nothing ever gets a 5 star review from me without reason. I start at the middle of the road (3 stars in this case) and find reasons to add or subtract from there. So, -1 for annoying marketing department causing me to review this but I kind of understand why... The previous gen 1 protects were a flop from what I've researched. Add 1 point for others reviews saying that these things actually do what they say they are going to do without false alarms. That leaves us at 3/5. Add 1 point for combining multiple smoke and co detection methods. Add another for creating a ""mesh"" network of interconnected detectors that can calmly and efficiently inform me of situations. Subtract a giant 1 point (hard time limiting this to only 1 star) for NOT integrating with other wired detectors. The orange/red wire exists for a reason and that's to kick off alerts in other areas!! I will buy more of these units until all in my home are replaced. 4 so far but have a half dozen or so to go in the next weeks/months assuming I don't find issues. Love the nightlight, btw."
Toys_and_Games_5,1,Got this for my 4 year old granddaughter. She loves it. She also loves the music and the lights. Great buy! I am a big fan of Tootle and it's been a hit with her. Highly recommend. I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it and it's great for her to keep her stuffed animals in the bath with her.
Electronics_5,0,"The factory ""calibration"" differs dramatically on these. I got two and both display very different colors. Even with adjustment, they are still different. Maybe it is the backlight on one of them. Nice thin bezel. 100mm VESA mount. Got both mine for 119 and 6 months apart. Don't overpay. No ghosting.

Cons - Wiggles when hit. the two I got are at different heights (off by .5mm). I just put some folded paper to raise one. One of them shipped without the screw to attach the base. I just used one I had laying around instead. The led flashed at night VERY BRIGHTLY if the monitors are on. I covered up the LEDs with two layers of duct tape. This is inconspicuous if done properly and helps with the light. Stand is a little big, but not too noticeable."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,If I could give this 0 stars I would. We have 2 cats and 2 litter pans making us have to change the litter once a week. This stuff clumps and is ultra fine making it nearly impossible to scoop because half the pan becomes like solid clay when liquid is introduced and the litter gets everywhere. We now have to change the litter about every 2-3 days. I will never recommend this garbage to anyone and will never buy it again. With how many good reviews and buys this had I was really excited but all we got was a tiny bag and complete disappointment. If you have more things to do with your life rather than changing litter every waking hour of the day this litter isn't for you. I wouldn't even spit in the general direction of this crap.
Movies_and_TV_5,0,"This is obviously a classic movie, and a favorite of mine for decades. I was sceptical of what Blu-ray could offer, but am dumfounded as to the new life given to this classic. I have never seen this movie like this presentation, and will never watch it any other way again."

Movies_and_TV_5,0,"When I first saw Twilight in 1998 I knew I was watching a valuable classic. We need a few more like Twilight these days to add intelligence that recent movies with action and adventure lack.  We need less high-tech-special-affects and more intriguing dialogue which includes humor, wit and wisdom that Twilight provides in abundance.
Listing the cast only was enough for me to go see the film : Paul Newman,
Gene Hackman, Susan Sarandon, James Garner, Stockard Channing, and with a
supporting cast of not-so-well-known actors who add to Twilight's appeal.
Among them (is/was) the late John Spencer, best known as the president's
secretary or chief aid in the TV series West End. Also, Reese Witherspoon
got an opportunity in this film playing the prodigal daughter of
Hackman/Sarandon. There are a few others who play character parts too.
I like the sophisticated decadence of Hollywood which Twilight so cleverly portrays with its sex, money, murder and cover-ups that are unearthed by Paul Newman, playing an aging ex-cop turned private-eye  which implicate friends and foes alike.
Here is a movie about old friendships, soon to be lost lives, and lost
illusions about life and love, that, in my opinion, make Twilight a modern classic for some soon-to-be ""late"" actors we have learned to love so much over the past fifty years."

Movies_and_TV_5,0,"The Mummy is a good example of a mediocre movie that is made interesting by the director's commentary on the DVD version.  In some ways the fact that it is not a very good movie makes the director's comments even more  fascinating, as we get explanations for what they were trying to do, and  some intriguing insights into the mind of a second-rate director.  Might be  worth buying if the DVD starts to disappear from rental shelves, which  eventually will happen."
Toys_and_Games_5,1,"If you have your hands on a basic computer, you know how to make a computer.  The other two have the same basic components.

You can use a 2-in-1 computer, or a 3-in-1 computer, or a 4-in-1 computer, or a 5-in-1 computer, or a 6-in-1 computer, or a 7-in-1 computer, or a 8-in-1 computer, and you can do that at home.  But you can also use a 3-in-1 computer and a 5-in-1 computer, and you can do that at home.  So it's not the best choice for the kids, but it's definitely a good option.  You can use the software to make a game of this sort, and the kids can play with their own computer.

Books_5,0,"The Atrocity Exhibition is a novel, or a series of short but connected stories, depending on how you decide to come at it.  Traven/Travis/Tallis/etc. appears as one man, moving through different evolutionary experiments, physical and psychological. He is experimenting with his psyche, as Ballard experiments with storytelling and writing. Chapter headings like ""The University of Death,"" ""Notes Towards a Mental Breakdown"" and ""You and Me and the Continuum"" give an idea towards the scope of the characters' inner and outer explorations.  The experimental sexual interactions, recurring alternate deaths and celebrity obsessions are from lists produced by Ballard using free assocation. Glimpses of themes of many of his later works can be found in this text.
Special features of the Re/Search revised edition includes an introduction by William S. Burroughs, new notes and comments from Ballard, and four additional short stories. Notes and commentary from Ballard himself run in the margins alongside the text to which they are related.  The collection of medical illustrations by Phoebe Gloeckner is impressive. Often overlooked are the excellent black and white urban images, photographed by Ana Barrado.  Her pictures are purposefully ""Ballardesque,"" showing abandoned parking lots, beaches and launch sites."

The only thing that I do like about it is the size of the hat. My son is 4 and loves to play with it. He's also the youngest one in the house and it is a little challenging for him to hold the pieces together. I think it is a nice toy for a little one, but not for a grown-up.

It is a little pricey for what it is, but I wouldn't hesitate to buy it for him.  My son will love it!Very cute, very well made, really cute.  I would buy again, but this one is a bit of a disappointment.  I would recommend this to anyone with kids.  The paint job is very good, and the plastic is very durable.

Books_5,0,"Okay, it's true.  I love Fannie Flagg books. Her characters are delightful, engaging, and quirky, but always memorable!. This summer, I've been reading some pretty heavy books about WWII, so I needed something light and fun. I turned to Flagg and her book about Elner Shimfissle.  Just from the name of the main character alone, you know you are in for a fun time. Elner touched so many lives for good over the course of her long life that her death, its aftermath, and visit to heaven, make for some laugh out loud reading.  I recommend this book to anyone who likes implausible, humorous books with feel good results and characters."

We leave the door open, because the air in Los Angeles is toxic and prevents flying critters from existing long enough to fly into our apartment.

It has a nice look to it feels strong. The swivel is a nice feature to have, and you can adjust it to make it tighter or looser.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"This wedding ring set arrived very quickly.  It really is a very nice set at a very reasonable cost.  It arrived in a very beautiful black velvet ring box.  I would not plan to wear this as an everyday ring set, since it is not a full white gold, just white gold plated, I would not expect it to hold up as well.  I like to wear different rings for different occasions, especially when traveling, so I don't have to worry about losing my actual ring set or having it stolen.

This set is very dainty looking and quite nice.  I ordered a size 7, which is what my original set is, and it fits perfectly. It's very comfortable to wear.  I take it off to wash my hands and I wouldn't sleep in it, so I have not seen any discoloration on the metal or on my hands.  For the price that this is offered at, I would definitely recommend it for someone to purchase as an extra set to wear on occasion.

Like most online shoppers, I read through reviews posted by others to determine whether I want to try out a product. I always do what I can to help by describing my purchases honestly. If I have been helpful please check yes, that it was helpful to you and I will do the same for all of the helpful reviews I find! Thank you for reading."

This shirt has been the best i've worn so far - it makes me feel cooler more comfortable on the trail runs.
Please note size chart below; the information was provided by Saucony and it seems Runners like to feel larger than they actually are compared to the rest of the population; therefore, saucony's sizes will run smaller than most manufacturers sizes.

The shirt performs very well and the only problem I have is the fit - My chest size is 48 and most XL's fit nicely,, however, this XL might be maxed out to 45 or 46.
Great Shirt - poor fit for larger chest sizes.

Saucony's Size Chart for men:

Small:  36-38
Medium:  39-40
Large:  41-43
XLarge:  44-46
XXL:  47-49"

Books_5,0,"So I had been behind on this series.  Then I binged all of them over last summer.  So when this book came out - I was way more than ready.  Charley and Reyes, omg, right?  I'm really late on this review, but here I am.  Better late than never!

I'm terribly sad that this series is winding down.  I heard there is one more book, but I don't know.  I am hoping there is.  But even then, I don't think it would be enough.

The series in general involves all of the things that I love.  Supernatural things, a badass woman, and a sexy dark man.  And the humor is top notch.

I don't want to give spoilers away, but the big secrets just keep coming out.  I don't know how Charley and Reyes will get through everything.  And this book in particular had some really heartbreaking things happen.  Let's just say at the end, there were tears.  Big fat sloppy tears and I feel like a big part of the heart of it all in this world Darynda Jones created will be forever bruised.  And then, as per I've become accustomed, the story ends with a BANG! and I'm frantic to read the next one.

If you've made it to the 12th book in this series, there's nothing I need to tell you.  You know Darynda Jones can create a world and make it revolve like nobodies business.  If you haven't gotten to this book, then you definitely need to."

Books_5,0,"This story is aging nicely. I read it again recently, many many years after reading it as a teen, and its charm is undiminished. Gentle, noble, gory and yucky in spots, displaying a deep love for the area and its people, and even including a sweet love story, this tale of a young veterinarian starting out in Yorkshire, England in the 1930's is well worth a read."
Books_5,0,"Yes, I understand the viewpoint of the reviewers who thought that this was not Tuchman's best work, because it certainly is different from Guns of August or Zimmerman, with their relentless and suspenseful narratives.
Nonetheless, this book represents brilliant work and sumptuous writing. In fact, I agree with those reviewers who think it may be her best work.  The book is a collection of essays, any one of which could stand proudly and separately. But when linked together, the separate chapters become a glorious symphony of historical insight.
When I was finished the book, I realized that I hadn't quite understood how the pieces fit together.  So I read the book again.  That's when I saw what a dazzling accomplishment this was. Indeed, like a symphony.
The book may even be worth a third read.  It's that good."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Our house came with an older Moen tub faucet that had been well-used. I bought this handle kit and a chrome escutcheon to dress it up. The handle came with a plastic adapter to attach it to the original cartridge, since the plastic knob has a horizontal screw holding it on, while this metal handle uses a vertical set-screw.
It all went together easily, but I had to disassemble and reassemble it a few times to get it working properly. The plastic adapter has a neat little assembly to restrict rotation, but possibly due to our setup, it wasn't long enough to stay in the stop tube. In other words, the water turned on fine, but then couldn't be shut off.
After removing a piece, the adapter and metal handle have been working fine, though I still feel a lot of slop in the connection. About an inch of the stop tube is exposed now, which doesn't look quite right, but again, I think it's due to our setup. I don't want to tear out the tub surround and replumb entire thing. If you're replacing a knob with this kit, just be aware it may not look quite as good as a new faucet. However, the price difference is substantial."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"I finally bought this after year-before-last's annual ""fight with the bird"", and am very happy I did.  This is large enough for all but my mother's ""monster"" birds - but she has a rimmed cutting counter my dad built for her so that doesn't count, right? The well is wonderful, big enough to hold the drips from even a large well rested turkey - this has been a major problem with other boards we had, the side drains and wells were ineffective at best in keeping the mess on the board and not all over the counter, but this one works, no mess!  At least not on the counter.  It is pretty enough that I have used it as a serving tray three times so far, for a holiday beef roast, a ham, and two roast chickens, all looked lovely. and I didn't have to worry about drips damaging my table.  It is a nice tight grain, and washes easily - I applied cutting board oil twice prior to using and after each use and wash - no staining or cracking so far and I've had it just over a year.  It looks like it will last a long time.  Very happy so far, will report back if that changes but looks like a great purchase so far."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,This silicone cake pan makes a great presentation. I made a chocolate cake and it turned out great. I have reviewed other silicone bakeware products for Amazon and have been happy with them. Clean up is super easy because almost no crumbs or residue from the cake remain in the pan. The cake did pop right out without it sticking to the inside. The instructions do say to bake with the pan placed on top of a cookie sheet. Great for a party as a way to showcase a cake.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,These are very nice to attach to your paracord bracelet as a backup to your primary tools. Compass is fairly accurate and the firestarter and light both work quite well. I have several of these and they all are quality tools. A few of the firestarters have a tendency to fall out due to a manufacturing issue. All you have to do is call CRKT and ask for parts department. They are very friendly and will ship out a replacement quickly. I got one in two days.

The Bad: The battery life is poor. If you want to get a solid charge, the battery life is great. The battery life is terrible. It will not charge a single time. This battery is still very good for the price.

The Bottom Line: I would recommend this battery to anyone who wants a great battery for a great price. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a battery that will last forever.

I love that the story is told from the perspective

I was very impressed with the writing style and the characters. I was also very impressed with the story. The book is a fast read with a great ending. I'll definitely be reading the next book in the series. This book was very informative and it made me feel as if I were in a better place. I would recommend this book to anyone. I loved this book. I was just so excited to read it and read it again. It was a wonderful story. It is filled with characters that are likable and I enjoyed the way they connected to each other. I had a hard time putting it down.

Movies_and_TV_5,0,"Wonderboys is an artsy film. It is about as far from the mainstream as you can get. Homosexuality, dead dog in the trunk, marijuana/alcohol abuse: such subject matter makes WB decidedly NOT a family or date movie. Not one you would watch with your mom. Wonderboys is best watched with open-minded friends or alone at night after a weird day. Masterful performances by Michael Douglas, Tobey Maguire, and Robert Downey, Jr.

 Michael Douglas is a college writing professor at a small school in Pennsylvania. He is having an affair with the chancellor's wife, and his second novel is either stalled or out of control. Enter James, his oddball class prodigy. Played by Maguire, James' pale face and helpless demeanor leads Douglas to take him under his wing. But instead of providing fatherly guidance, Douglas and his editor pal Robert Downey Jr. lead James on lots of frat-boy hijinks.

 Wonderboys will especially be appreciated by anyone who is a writer. The film will leave you with a thoughtful smile."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"Ok so I just got these and they fit really well (In my opinion). Im a womens size 7 1/2 and I got in a mens 6. These are the Rewinds and the seller says that they are in men sizes only.

When I first got the skates I had a hard time turning corners but after loosening the axle a bit I still have trouble but its probably just because I need to practise.

The wheels are harder than I expected and not for rough surfaces like roads (though Im sure I read that they could be used outdoors) so I might need to buy softer wheels to do that.

For an affordable skate its good and from the looks of it, it most likely will last me a good while until I can afford the Moxi skates.

So basically size is good & fits good. The only issue right now is the limiting wheels."

The other two have the same design, but they have different sights, so you should get the right one. It will cost you a bit more for the same sight as the other two, but it is a nice value. I would recommend this sight to anyone who wants to take a different sight set. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to get a very good quality scope for their needs. Very nice, quick delivery, and great price. I recommend this product to everyone. Just what I wanted for my AR-15. Great quality and price. I had some other reviews and this one was my favorite. I can tell you I've had a few of these and they work great."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"I collect knives and tried this low priced traditional 'toothpick' from Buck.
Like a number of Bucks knives now, this is made in China, so I'll quickly hit a few potential quality control hot spots:

The jigged bone handle scales: mounted to the frame of the knife with no visible gaps or defects, no problem there. The jigging itself is deep and well defined, not REfined as on a Case knife, but it's low priced (an equivalent Case toothpick would cost you at least 5 times as much.) The bone material seems OK.

The blade: Evenly ground on both sides, came paper-shearing sharp (just shy of hair-shaving.) No defects. Bucks prolific 420HC steel- perfectly decent steel, Buck has a particularly good heat treat in testing. I own the Buck 119 special large fixed blade which uses the same steel.

The bolsters: Nice and glossy, the pins are buffed to near invisibility.

Blade pivot point: The blade snaps open firmly, no play side to side or up and down. It is of course a slip joint blade and does not ""lock.""

Overall, 9/10 for value. A fine choice as a gift, as a light duty every day carry pocket knife, or as a budget ""gentleman's folder"" (I bought it with this latter purpose in mind- it is thin, lightweight, and looks nice.)

In future I may try some of the competing low priced 'toothpicks' from companies like Boker, Columbia River Knife and tool, and Frosts ""Steel Warrior"" series."
Movies_and_TV_5,0,Very interesting movie. The play back quality was no to good. I never complained to Amazon about this. They contacted me via e-mail and refunded my rental amount. That's why Amazon is #1 in customer service! Great job! That's why I'm PRIME!!!!!
Kindle_Store_5,0,"It was so freaking long! There was just too much detail and I really didn't need to know every move they made every day. Very flowery, sappy dialogue was used a lot. I disliked Chase's prejudiced generalization that bisexual men are predisposed to cheat because they are attracted to both sexes. Cheaters are predisposed to cheat and it has nothing to do with sexuality. And he had that viewpoint prior to the boyfriend that cheated with a woman.

I also disliked the fact that Gray spent 10 years with Devon and dismissed it all so casually. Devon should never have cheated and never should have stayed if their relationship was so bad for 4 whole years. Maybe he was as manipulative as he was depicted. But Gray should be blamed as well, when he was the one avoiding intimacy and was too lazy and too complacent to make a clean break. Also, later in the book, he said he owned his house before Devon and Devon only lived there for a year. After 10 years together? That makes no sense.

I know that much of the story was introducing characters for future stories and I liked some of them. I did make it through the whole story but it was a chore. I never connected with the characters. They both seemed immature in many ways. Their little breakup was ridiculous and was no more than a setup for another long sappy make up scene. Added nothing to the book. So I might read the next book because of other characters but only if they're written more cleanly and with less syrupy dialogue."
Electronics_5,0,"I bought the 8CH 4 camera system for our office.  Our office is all on one level and the width of the office is about 150 feet.  The main NVR unit if located about 80 feet from the farthest camera with only a partial wall between the unit and farthest camera.  Out of the box the system is easy to use. The screen you use to specify the time the cameras should record motion is cumbersome because it is a grid of rectangle 24 (hours) x 7 days and if you make a mistake you cannot uncheck a box and thus need to start over.  The android app for viewing the cameras works well and so does the desktop app.  If you need more than 4 cameras , all you need to do is buy the additional cameras , up to 4 more for a total of 8.  Pairing the camera with the system is easy.  If you need the signal to go through cinder-block walls you may want to consider another system.  I had one camera in our warehouse at about 200 feet away with a cinder block separating the warehouse from the front office NVR.  I got intermittent results in terms of the signal reaching the NVR.  Other reviews I read stated you can replace the antenna's on the cameras to boost the range and signal strength, but the antenna's on my camera do not twist off nor could I pull them off.  These cameras detect motion and it may be helpful to realize that ""motion"" is anything that causes pixels to change.  We were getting false motion alerts because sunlight bouncing off of outside nearby moving traffic was reflecting on a wall and the camera nearby was picking this up.  In terms of ""night vision"" the cameras work best if there is a little bit of light.  If I needed to buy a system for my house I would consider this system."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"I did return mine - I have all tile floors with room rugs, and being semi-retired and self-employed from home I spend a lot of time in my slippers walking on the tile. The original cork built-up soles on the OG clogs are perfect for this whereas when I wear this Charisma with it's soft thinner sole in comparison it SEEMS I can almost feel the floor though the sole. That means not enough support for wearing them 10-12 hours a day every day. DANG it I love them and they were only $42 from Warehouse Deals....I do wish they had worked out! If you like the look I would encourage you to try them out and see for yourself how they feel. As a general house slipper, especially on wall to wall padded carpeting and just light use in morning, evening and weekends I bet they'd be GREAT.

DETAILS: Charisma is unmistakably a slipper (as opposed to a clog that could be worn as a shoe). Charisma has a snug fit - the size 42 for women's size 11 had my toe pushing right up at the top. Bear in mind one of my feet is 10.5 and the other 11 - the 10.5 foot thought the length was perfect. The fabric is very soft with some give and they actually felt OK even with my toes nicely wrapped up - for the 10 minutes I tried.  Like the OG clog style, these do have the molded foot bed with the slightly built up arch support. They are nowhere near as tough and stiff as the OG clog style; the sole is thinner and more flexible especially at the toes which are not bulbous and padded as are the OG clog style. The bottom of these soles are covered in thin ""grips"" that mildly keep them from slipping on tile so I would say these are not for use outdoors - much."

Books_5,0,"An eye opening look at the inside government prospective on both the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.  Regardless of how you may feel about Iraq this book explains the day to day struggle that was the reality of this conflict and how it interacted with Afghanistan.  I was impressed with the involvement that President Obama had with getting Bin Laden.  I had always assumed that it just happened on his watch, but he was much more deeply involved than I thought.  I'll give him credit for that, but not much else.  The way Obama grinds though flag officers makes me wonder how much longer the military system will continue to produce the highly competent high level Generals and Admirals we must have to stay safe in a world that seems to hate us for who we are.  Thankfully there are people like Bob Gates who will lead and endure the realities of public life for the sake of our country."
Kindle_Store_5,0,"I obviously should have read the blurb better... I really enjoyed reckless for cowboy in this series and was quite surprised to find this book had more than a smattering of bondage and even a visit to a bdsm club, very graphic content and not what I was expecting. Having said that if this is your cup of tea then you may enjoy this book. Very thin on plot and the characters are lacking in depth."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"This has been a nice little grill for making family breakfast. I like that it is none stick and has the cooling boundary around it. Bacon takes a while to cook on it but pancakes and eggs are fast. Decent to clean, wish it was dish washer safe. Over all very happy with it."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,Only had it less than a week ago. I've now used it for about a week. I am very happy with it. The ring is a little too loose and the color is a little too loose. I think it might be a little snug. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.
Kindle_Store_5,0,"I received a free copy from the author in exchange for an honest review. Another great boxed set by Nikki Steele, who is a wondeful author. Loved this story of Libby and Jax. So sexy and romantic. Libby has a complex about her looks and an eating disorder she has trouble controlling. It is all mainly due to her beautiful sister who recieves all her parents attention and the fact that she stole Libby's first boyfriend she loved..She can't believe when she meets Jax, that he could care about her the way she looks. She is scared that if her sister meets Jax, she will steal him away from her like before. Loved this series, especially how Nikki ended each book with a wonderful recipe that Libby had cooked in each story."
Movies_and_TV_5,0,"What a stinker! I am a lover of horror films and I really regret buying this film. The trailer makes it look decent and some of the reviews gave it a pretty positive rating so I figured it might be good; I was wrong. This is nothing like Creepshow or any other decent anthology. I lacks atmosphere and feels very rushed. The entire film feels like they just didn't care. The effects may have been decent if they were used properly but they are poorly utilized here. I was hopeful when I saw some of the cast and writer/directors associated with this, esp. using Adrienne Barbeau (sp), the narrator from the Fog and actress in allot of decent horror flix like the original Creepshow, Escape from New York, and others, but  but it was a trust misplaced. I realized my mistake in purchasing this film within minutes and so will you if you are foolish enough to pay for this movie. Wait for it to be free on Amazon or Netflix if you must watch it, but be warned, it isn't even worth watching for free!"

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"I'd consider myself an advanced non-professional photographer...which means I have a DSLR with two lenses (a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Canon-EOS-Rebel-T3/dp/B004J3Y9U6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Canon EOS Rebel T3</a>), an external flash, and a random assortment of other camera items (an old Canon point-and-shoot, a waterproof point-and-shoot, an HD video camera, the assorted SD cards, lens covers, etc.). I currently have the el cheapo Canon bag that came with my Rebel and I barely use it, so hoped that by getting a REAL camera bag, I'd be more apt to consolidate everything into one bag and carry it with me. Unfortunately, it hasn't been the case. I blame the fact that I'm generally already carrying a diaper bag with me, LOL.

PROS:

The bag is definitely WELL MADE. The fabric is thick and the stitching is heavy-duty. The velcro isn't sewn on cheaply so that it will start pulling off after a handful of uses. Comparing it to my Canon bag is like night and day. Everything on the Canon bag feels cheap while everything on the Lowepro feels luxurious.

The bag is very adaptable and adjustable. The insides are full velcro panels so that you can rearrange the inserts in any which way you need and there are lots of pockets. I like that the cover panel folds over onto itself so that the top becomes very easily accessible (being covered without actually being latched shut in any way).

There is no logo on the outside, so this bag could be any generic messenger bag. There's no clue that it could be holding thousands of dollars of equipment.

CONS:

If you don't have enough equipment to really fill it, it's a bit of overkill.

I actually thought about using it as a diaper bag, but it seems like it might be a little hard to clean if anything spilled on the inside.

OVERALL, I can see how this would be a rockin' bag to have if you were a professional photographer or had lots of equipment you needed to carry around at the same time. But for me, as the advanced home user, it's overkill."

From The Book: A Novel by Diana Adams

Author: Diana Adams

Publisher: T&E

I enjoyed this book.  It was a very interesting story about the lives of three young people who have been separated for over 50 years.  As they are getting older and having to deal with the past, they are facing a new life together.  They are both young women who are very interested in each other.  They are both going through a difficult time, but they are also going through a very difficult time.  They are both trying to make it through the time together.  The story was very well written and the characters were well developed.  I think the main reason I give it 5 stars was because it was a very good story.  I think the book is very well written and the story line is very interesting.  I think I would recommend it to anyone.  I am not sure if this is the best or the worst book"

Toys_and_Games_5,1,"This is one of those things where you want to try something new and make it seem like you've mastered it. The plastic parts are very sturdy, and the cover is very sturdy. The blades are very sturdy, and the pieces can be easily bent to form a shape. I like that the blades are held together by a metal band around the blade. I also like that the blades are very flexible, as if you're holding the blades in place, they will bend if you're trying to bend the blades. I love that they're made of a very durable material, and that the blades are really sturdy. Overall, I'm happy with this purchase, and I highly recommend it to anyone who has any interest in the sounds of a child's head or body. This product is great for any child who enjoys playing with a toy. My granddaughter loved this doll."

She does awkward better than anyone else, and I definitely felt the awkwardness between her character and her childhood rival.  A lot of people have said they thought the rivalry was immature, but who hasn't been around someone who brings out our worse.  I thought it was hilarious to watch.  I'm glad I've got another wonderful Christmas hallmark movie to add to my growing collection."
Books_5,0,"This is a book about a young man with a dark past and a young woman with a future on which she placed all of her faith. Lucas hadn't known Jacqueline, but he had watched her from a distance. Jacqueline didn't even know that Lucas truly existed until one night he saved her from a horrible incident. Now it seems as if she keeps running into him. Jacqueline can't get him out of her head. Lucas is the ""bad boy"" with the tattoos to go along with that stereotype. He is sexy in every way. He's good looking, has tattoos, is mysterious, and knows how to teach a girl how to defend herself. Jacqueline can't seem to keep herself away from the mystery of him. This book is full of angst and passion, and takes you through the journey of falling in love and lust.
 I fell in love with this book! I enjoyed the mystery that surrounded Lucas and the love/lust that Lucas and Jacqueline shared. This was a book that was written to emulate real life, which was a nice break from all the fantasy I have been reading. I thought this book was going to just be a love/lust book with not much else going on, but there was an adventure presented by the incidents that happened as well as deception. I was entertained through the whole length.
I found out that there will be a second book, Breakable, being released May 6, 2014. You better believe that I have already pre-ordered it!
I rated this book 5/5 stars and highly recommend it."

My cat was able to eat it with no problems at all.  My vet said it was a good product, but not the best.  She also said it was not necessary for cats that are resistant to fleas.

The other 2 movies were pretty funny throughout the whole movie and this one has hits and misses. There were parts i was laughing till i almost cried and other parts that were not funny at all. This one has more parodys of sci fi movies mainly and 8 mile. The last 2 focused more on horror. Here they parody the movie signs , the ring and 8 mile. The last 2 films had more movie parodys of all diffrent horror films and this film has popular culture parodys and sci fi. If your a fan of the first two , get this one to complete the trilogy and if you havnt seen the others or just thought they were so so rent this. Youll get a couple good laughs. Also i don't agree with the reviews that say the only funny parts are in the movie commercials they showed. All the funny parts i saw were not in the commercials and the one from the commercial ( the Micheal Jackson part) wasn't that funny and that wasn't really Micheal Jackson, it was a micheal jackson imitator. Overall i give it 3 and a half stars. Pretty good."

We have a fancy goldfish that is absolutely loving his new tank, as are we.  He's been in his home for a week, his water is still crystal-clear, and the tank was a breeze to set up and maintain.  I honestly couldn't be happier.  My only (slight) concern is that the tank goes get a tiny bit warm when the light is on (up to about 76/78) so it's not perfectly ideal for goldfish if you want the light on all the time, as apparently they prefer a bit cooler water.

There's plenty of room to play with decorating (I have the 5gal hex), and I'm just itching to go buy at least a snail & couple of tiny companions for Turkey-the-Goldfish because this is such an enjoyable tank you really want to take advantage of it.

Honestly, I can't recommend it highly enough."

In reading this, my grandson and I explored the places on earth where they lived. We discovered which ones ate which foods. This was a delightful trip into the past and my grandson and I loved it. The only thing I thought was a bit askew was the title. The title didn't appropriately describe the main topic of the book. It was more about the variety and life of dinosaurs as opposed to the creatures that flew. In full disclosure, I received this book at no cost in return for an unbiased opinion of the contents. Your young children will love it!"

Pet_Supplies_5,0,"The Gentle Leader Headcollar is AMAZING!!! I have a 3 1/2 year old newly adopted rescue puggle who take way more after his beagle mother and has beyond an impeccable nose and sensing abilities. So our usual walks on a regular 6ft leash were more of him running towards all the different scent trails he smelled and me dragging behind trying to keep up while in the process of not being able to be as fast as him, he would pull on the leash, therefore choking/causing restriction to himself. I was not happy about this - not only was he uncomfortable, but so was I. This morning I was delivered the Gentle Leader headcollar and went home for lunch to test it out ..... WOW!!! Even after reading all the great reviews here, I seriously did not expect it to work on the first try, but was so very pleasantly surprised. No difficulty putting on, my puggle, Chewy, seemed comfortable with it on (although on occasion he did paw at it since he is not used to wearing something around his muzzle area) but did not show any sign of discomfort. With the first few steps he was beginning to walk by my side or a tiny bit behind me and followed my lead versus just running off after any/all random scent trails! I still allow him to follow all the scent trails he sniffs, but we do it at an acceptable rate versus having the 'zoomies' towards all the scents. This is just our first walk in the first day too!! Imageine how much better our walks/jogs will improve over the course of the next several days/weeks!! YAY - finally I will have a wonderfully trained leashed companion on my ventures!"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"I purchased this in blue to put under my dining room table to protect the wood floors. While I don't have a problem with the quality so far, there is this awful stench coming from the rug. It smells like chemicals. I thought the smell would dissipate after a few days.. I was wrong. Also, if you have pets you can see just about every bit of hair on it. I wished I wouldn't of purchased this but it's too late. Not absolutely horrible- just not for me.

***UPDATE 6/1/16***
I am truly regretting this rug especially in this color!! . Every little speck of dust and animal hair and shows up and it always looks dirty even after I vacuum it. I have a great vacuum so I definitly know that's not the problem."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"I bought 1 of these to compare against other bulbs because it had decent reviews. This one was ok, but not as nice as the G7 Power G7GU10300WW for the same price. Please consider trying the G7 bulb and read my review of it.

UPDATE Dec-31-2013:

HitLights has sent me the updated bulb for 2014 to compare with the older bulb, and I'm pleased to say it is much improved from the old design. I'm also pleased they offered to send my a new bulb free of charge to try. Thats good customer service! First off the height of the bulb is now normal. It will not stick out of the fixture you place it in, like the old bulb did. The bulb looks exactly like what they have in the current pictures. I measured the new bulb as consuming 3.9 watts, which is more efficient than the old model (4.4 watts) and the same as my old favorite, the G7. The new bulb is a lot brighter too. I measured it at 5100 lux @ 1 foot away, compared to the old model @3860 lux. Its still not as bright as the old G7 at 7200 lux. But its acceptable. It comes on instantly and has a fairly linear dimming ability with a standard Lutron dimmer. It does have a little bit of yellow fringing at 1 foot away, but over several feet onto my dark brown granite countertop, it was mostly unnoticeable. Since the G7 is not available now, I would not hesitate to give this bulb a try. G7 however has redesigned their GU10 style bulb and it should be available soon. I always prefer products made in the USA, like the G7. I'm pretty sure this HitLights is still made in China."
Electronics_5,1,"packaged well, comes with all the necessary adapters.  The included adapter comes with a small screw"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"I really like it! its got good coverage and is modest and sporty at the same time!

The reviews said the Bust ran big and you should believe this. To give you an idea on that..........
I'm a petite size small and sometimes medium. My shoulders and rib cage are slightly bigger than the typical ""petite"" size. I wear a size 3 to 5  jean and am 5 1"" or so with a B 1/2 cup size and 35 Bust..... I'm an in-betweener.
.I ordered the Med to give me more coverage But when I tried it on it WAS a little too big around by 1 inch and the straps are too long by 2 inches
I'm going to do the alteration on it and it will fit perfect. I guess I got the bigger size for a couple of  reasons:
I thought it would be too short and I didn't want to take a chance it would be too snug

I guess I could have ordered the small But I think the cup size would have been slightly too small? Well they can't make every body type I guess.lol
over all I really love  this Tankini. I like how there's a seam under the bust and pleats down the middle Bust to give support and the fabric gives good support too. The way the straps and cups are designed,gives the suit good coverage for a fuller cup size.

If I ordered another one I would try the small. I can't wait to wear it! this summer!
I also ordered some swim shorts to go with it"

Electronics_5,0,It does what it is supposed to do. I am a little concerned in the packaging of the product as it appeared to have been opened. There were the included cables still in plastic so I am not sure if this was box was just opened or it was a used product repackaged. The only other issue is that the polarized plugs really were difficult to plug in. I had to use the blade of a screwdriver to get them all the way flush into the surge protector on the standard size outlet side. No issues on the large outlets for the power adapters.

The movie has a couple of extra scenes, but, they're just too short to be worth it. The only extras are the special features, which are nothing special. This movie is still worth seeing.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"I purchased this after a friend recommended it to me.  I am not a power baker.  I merely make the usual things for my family and the occasional specialty items.  I find it mixes faster than my old stand mixer, and it takes less space on my counter.  Contrary to other reviewers, I find it does cream sugar and butter well, BUT I have to use a rubber spatula to push it off the center post.  MY machine came with instructions to NOT use the center addition for the smaller jobs like this since it produces better results, so that is how I have done it.

In addition, I noticed straightaway that the directions stated to ensure you run the machine at least 5 minutes before you do ANYTHING in it to make sure the lubricants do their job BEFORE you use it for mixing. I did that, and I've heard no odd noises coming from my machine.

It IS loud.....much louder than my stand mixer, but I wasn't going for a silent machine.  Frankly, I have dexterity issues, and I wanted one that wasn't overly heavy, with a bowl that wasn't overly heavy, and that was easy to clean without having to wrestle it all over the kitchen (with my issues, that's common).  My friend suggested that this would probably tick off all those checkboxes, and she was right.

For what I use it for, I LOVE it.  It is also easy to clean, the parts store in the top, and it does what I ask it to.  I also got the blender attachment with mine, and it blends stuff that my bullet cannot.  I don't use it OVERLY often, but when I need a blender, it's a champ.  The only thing I don't like about the blender is that you cannot remove the bottom and blades to clean it.  If I used it daily or for anything very sticky, that would bother me, but I'm just a batter making, smoothie making gal, and it's great for that."

It does what it's supposed to do. It's easy to shoot and easy to conceal. I've shot about 1,000 rounds in it, and it's actually not bad. It's super light and easy to carry. It's a good price. I'm not a big fan of the red dot and this thing does the job perfectly. I can see why I would buy it. It has a good grip, but I have to adjust the sights to get it to look like it was shot.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"Not sure what to say about this lantern that hasn't already been said. It floats, it has multiple lighting options, it hangs, you can take off the cover for direct lighting, it has a red mode and it just plain works. I've used it in the rain, in the water, in temperatures below 0F and in tropical locales. This sure gives my gas lamps a run for the money. I just can't say enough good things about this tough lantern. Its survived a 5 foot drop on the ground, being covered in snow and even a fall in the water. Not to mention all the sand and dirt and crap that goes with that. And it still works.

I use enloop AA's with C adapters and thats one less battery type I gotta bring with me."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"My interest in this 8"" pan was to satisfy my longing for the perfect over easy egg.
In my quest = I had already purchased Calphalon Unison Slide frying pan and was very pleased with it.
So much so that I gushed about it in a review 2 - 3 yrs back.

Turns out this pan is even better = nicely browns the egg - cooks evenly and quicker.
And because it's completely grease-less non-stick, it only needs wiped out with paper towel.
Has a very adequate and comfortable silicone handle = doesn't get hot.
Stands up to what one would expect at this price point, and it doesn't disappoint.

> This is outstanding construction and indeed 100% non-stick.
The triple bottom is an excellent heat conductor. Cooks well on medium heat.

> About being able to use metal utensils with this pan = I found that a bit contradictory.
While product description says yes, the pamphlet with the pan says = they strongly recommend not to.

> And while it is said to be dishwasher safe, same pamphlet says = yes, but due to hard water and detergent
the non stick coating may lose its effectiveness. So I would interpret that as a no.

> Can be used on all stove tops = gas - electric - vitro ceramic stove top - induction - halogen & in the oven.
Pan does not come with a lid, but any 7 7/8"" (rim inset - to rim inset) lid will fit well.
In our cupboard = a Chantal = Revere Ware - & Calphalon lid fit perfectly.

Made in Italy
(We have some other pans and utensils from Italy of which have turned out to be some of our best & favorite kitchen items)

Manufacture states this is scratch & stain resistant.
10 times more resistant to sticking than normal non stick coatings. (which I believe is true)
18/10 stainless steel
PFOA free
---------------------

No grease.
Within seconds of egg hitting the pan, the thin front edge cooked and rolled upwards.
Egg was quickly nicely browned, which made it easier to flip without breaking.
Took about 30 seconds on top side = over easy = done.
Lifted egg out, pan was clean."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"Let me start by saying I bought this to replace my Technivorm, which no longer was doing the job correctly. The Bonavita is half the price, and does the same thing: hot coffee at the proper brewing temperature, and quickly, too. My initial impression of it out of the box is that it is solid and very well made. Compared to Technivorm I would say it is just as good quality.
There are some feature differences. First, the part where the coffee goes sits directly on top of the carafe on the Bonavita. I find this a little awkward because it's hard to remove the carafe once the coffee is brewed; a little more clearance on top would solve this. Secondly, the carafe doesn't have that nifty lid like the Technivorm has, which allows the coffee to mix in the carafe. In other words, you have to stir the coffee after brewing in the Bonavita. Thirdly, there is no adjustable flow on the Bonavita. This is not a bad thing, as I was always having problems with the Technivorm getting plugged up during brewing (I use a permanent filter.) This doesn't happen at all on the Bonavita because it has just a hole set slightly up on the side--instead of on the very bottom--- where the coffee drips out. The only drawback to this is there is always going to be 1/4 or 1/2 an inch of coffee in the bottom of the ""brew cup"", which has to be poured out into the carafe. However,you never have to worry about coffee dripping out the bottom all over your counter every time you lift it off the carafe.
Overall, this is a great replacement for the Technivorm, which is frankly overpriced. The Bonavita is much simpler to operate. I am very pleased with this purchase!"

The book is paired with Home, which is as good in a different way."

The plot is pretty simple to follow, and there are some pretty good gun fights. But, the acting is pretty lacking. Therefore, I do not recommend watching this movie, unless you are a pretty big John Wayne fan. If not, check out some of his earlier Westerns."

And, like most USB wi-fi adapters, it has no means for stowing or otherwise retaining that cap when the adapter IS in use. My guess is that most people eventually lose the cap. This is of no real consequence except, perhaps, aesthetics.

The best improvement in wi-fi performance is achieved by using the provided extension cord to position the adapter above and away from your computer, where it can get the best possible signal. Of course, there's no reason why you couldn't buy your own USB extension cord and use that to improve the signal with a more conventional USB wi-fi adapter. But the antenna, which actually contains metal parts configured in a way that really does boost the gain, still gives the TL-WN722N an edge over a nano adapter with an extension cord.

As with most USB wi-fi adapters, this one comes with unneeded wi-fi management software. (Most wi-fi management software has been superfluous since Windows XP Service Pack 3 gave Windows robust, built-in wi-fi management.) Unlike with some other adapters, there is no way to install just the drivers you need while omitting the management software that you don't need. But after it's installed, you can set Windows as the wi-fi manager."
Kindle_Store_5,1,I find it interesting that this book is the first in a series by this author. I just can't get enough of her books. I can't wait to read more of her books. The author takes her time to develop a strong character. I love her characters and the way that the story flows. I liked the way the story line was told and the characters were so well developed. I just wish there was more to the story. The story was interesting and well written. The characters were well developed and the storyline was interesting. I liked the fact that the author was able to develop a strong character and the way that the story was told. I can't wait to read the next book.
Electronics_5,0,"Well, I've been using it for quite sometime now and I honestly don't like it very much.

The fact that I've actually bought two sets of these makes it even worse. I'll keep the review short and simple.

Pros:
1. Easy to install and use
2. Buttons light up, can turn the feature on or off

Cons:
1. Buttons lights up and off too quickly, lights do not stay long enough
2. Distance for radio signal is poor, it's best not to have interference or obstacles in front or in between the signal path
3. The mouse wheel is infrared sensor, which kind of works but not as well as a mouse wheel. It's not as precise and you almost always lose track
4. Due to poor signals, I would constantly have to type something on TV and look at the pad, then look at the TV again to make sure the signal took the input, because sometimes it would not.

Gave it 3 stars for Lenovo at least trying to improve a product but did not really do a good job."

Movies_and_TV_5,0,"I recently saw this movie on television and knew that it needed to be in my DVD library.  This film is about a bacteriologist (Edward Norton) who very quickly falls in love with a young lady (Naomi Watts), they marry, and he takes her back to China where he's stationed as a English civil servant.  She doesn't really love him when they marry and tells him that, but she looks at marrying him as a way to get out of her home and away from her mother since there aren't any other prospects for her.  In China she gets bored with him and her life there and winds up having an affair with a low level English diplomat.  I won't say any more but suffice it to say that this movie just slowly sucks you in -- the art direction, the photography, the styling -- you feel as if you're in China in the 1930's.  The acting is superb, in my opinion, because it is not-in-your-face.  Rather, it is subtle and there are moments when a glance, or smirk, or a move of the head evokes the feeling vs. words.  Naomi Watts seems perfect for the part of the wife, and Edward Norton plays the repressed, formal English man to perfection.  The supporting cast - especially Toby Jones, are also superb.  Too bad that this movie didn't garner more attention when it came out because it certainly deserves a viewing.  It's a different kind of love story with no violence, no naked bodies, no CGI graphics, no swearing, no car/motorcycle/truck action shots -- that explains why it probably didn't make $300 billion dollars at the box office.  Oh well...."

It was very much Fifty Shades of Grey in the gaming world, and parts were a little like Pretty Woman, but both with a more independent and intelligent heroine.  The only distractions were that the entire book needs an editor to proofread it, and maybe a little too much detail about what the main characters were wearing.

Kindle_Store_5,0,"FINALLY! I can't tell you how long I've been waiting for The Alpha King, but I know I've worked my way through a few versions of the Kindle since I first read The First Alpha!

I fell deeply in love with this series way back in 2013, and since then I've checked back every week for news on the sequel. Now it's here I know it was worth the wait! I fell in love with Thomas Smith from the first page, but when I realised who he was - and how he works into the world of the Five Tribes - I fell in love all over again. I don't want to give away the twist, but if you've read The First Alpha you'll be blown away when you... well, you'll know it when you see it :)

As for the romantic element, LOVE IT! I love a ballsy, take no prisoners heroine, and I love how Evelyn deals with the men she encounters in this male-dominated world of 1912. She's more than a match for 'Thomas' (or should I call him... no, no spoilers), and I can't wait to see how they deal with the Ironclaws now they're a team.

You'd think that a movie like this would be so terrible, but it's not. I just wanted to give it a bad review because I just don't get how bad this movie is.

The movie has its flaws and I can't blame them for it. I was a little disappointed in the ending. I didn't expect anything to happen in this movie. It was just so boring. I just couldn't enjoy it.

Movies_and_TV_5,1,"This film was originally conceived as a satire on the ""White Queen"" who is the daughter of the wealthy and powerful woman, the Queen.  The film was shot in a very large city with many beautiful women.  The film was shot in the spirit of ""The White Queen"" with no racial or gender differences.  The film is about the rise of the female monarch, the Queen, and the Queen's rise to power.  The Queen's rise to power is not based on the fact that she is a woman, but rather on the fact that she is the daughter of a wealthy and powerful man.  The film does not attempt to challenge the notion that the White Queen is a woman, but rather to examine the relationship between the Queen and the wealthy and powerful.

Books_5,0,"""Destroyer Angel"" made me sad. It's not only the violent, depressing story, but also the fact that this may be the last Anna Pigeon novel I read. I have been reading Nevada Barr's books for many years now and have been disappointed in the dark turn this series has taken. I absolutely loved the earlier books in this series, which could never be accused of being ""cozies"", but included wonderful descriptions of National Parks and a variety of realistic characters. I thought the premise of this story being a story of survival sounded intriguing, so I gave it a try. After finishing the book, I can say I liked it better than recent installments such as ""The Rope"", but didn't like it nearly as well as earlier books in this series.

I liked the vivid characterizations of the female characters and descriptions of the setting, but the male villains are interchangeable and their actions are appalling. Having the story told from different points of view added some interest, but also added redundancy and slowed the pace of the book. Some may enjoy this as a story of good vs. evil, but it's not my kind of story and even the great character of Anna Pigeon couldn't save it for me. The author has obviously chosen to take this series in a new direction, so it looks like we may be parting ways."

If any of you out there are Baby Boomers who practiced ""duck and cover"" exercises in elementary school and then several years later, still in the middle of the ""Cold War"", read the fabulous book ""On the Beach"", by Nevil Shute, you may find yourself feeling that same, strange blurring of reality and possibility as you finish ""In Situ"". On one hand, I kept waiting for something/someone to save the day, but I realize that would have ruined the book. I don't want to give any spoilers here. Just read the book!!! I promise, you'll love it."
Books_5,1,"Seemingly the mature reader would find it difficult to finish. I did find that the characters were pretty interesting. There was a lot of intrigue throughout the book, and the author was very clear that it was a thriller.

The book was enjoyable. I liked the setting and the setting of the book. I liked the characters and the setting of the book. I liked the fact that the author was able to pull off a few twists and turns, but it was well done. The book was very well written, and the setting was very well developed."

Electronics_5,0,"I mainly got this because I needed something to be able to watch the movies that I like when the main t.v. and computer are both being used by others. I can put my earphones in, sit back at the table and watch my movies to my hearts desire, not disturbing anyone else or them disturbing me.
I love the fact that I could get it in pink...keeps the menfolk away from MY little DVD player..lol I see nothing wrong with the picture or sound quality, it's all alright with me!"
Pet_Supplies_5,0,The great charcoal for a typical aquarium and value priced. However don't use it on low pH aquariums like Tetra's or Discus as if you have the pH adjusted down this will raise it. I soaked it for a week and rinse before and after the soak to help prevent the pH change but it happened anyway.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"The toe area ripped on my first day wearing these (a 3 mile ride). Pics for reference. I didn't scrape my toe against the ground. Maybe I just pulled them on too tight? If I hadn't, the under strap would have covered my cleats and I wouldn't have had a solid connection with my pedals. I'll stick with warmer socks."

Pet_Supplies_5,0,The concept was nice but was very disappointed with the quality of the materials used. It is a fleece like material but is basically threadbare. The cats are basically laying on particle board. Had they used just a little thicker/softer material I would have given this 5 stars. I would not purchase again.

Toys_and_Games_5,0,"This kit is fun and easy to use. We dyed 4 kids' shirts dry, which used up most of the dye. (They used several colors each!) The shirts have been laundered several times in cold water, and are still just as bright as they were when we made them. I would definitely recommend this kit. It is a good value for the price, because there are so many colors to choose from and the kit includes everything you need except the shirts."
Electronics_5,0,Have this for almost a year and it plays everything I throw at it at max resolution and graphics setting wonderfully!
Electronics_5,0,Just replace my old ones. No holes just screw them in.
Pet_Supplies_5,0,Bert litter system in the world.  I've had this before and they improved the product.  The holes are smaller so the pellets don't get stuck. This is worth every penny.  Only takes a few minutes a day to clean as opposed to an hour with other litter systems.  The pass and pellets are expensive but worth the money. 15$ a month (one pack of pellets and pads per month is all you need for 2 cats).

Beware though that this is not your Sorry.  This game was fun if you are not expecting to plat the game you loved as a child.  The fire and ice ""coins"" are confusing.  You have to read the directions a few times and then play it how you find easiest (they are confusing).  I will have to find an original version of this game, but it's okay as an alternative."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,Elegant. Rich looking. Love them. Just right size for vanity in bathroom. Would recommend.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,I really like this design.  Much easier that the older style where you had to reach down and move the device to hold the door open.  To close all you do is push the door open just a bit more and the door closes automatically. Nice when you are carrying something.

Books_5,0,"I have just returned from a journey into the past, because of the genius, passion, and attention to historic detail of KAT MARTIN.  I just finished the most glorious story of love, adventure, unsurpassed sensuality, honor and devotion that you could ever wish to read.  Set in old California during the difficult and often violent transition from Spanish to American control the love story of Ramon and Caralee is spellbinding.  I almost cried when it ended.  If you do nothing else today get this book.  I guarantee you will not be able to put it down.  Thank you times a hundred, Kat for this treasure."

Kindle_Store_5,0,The chemistry from the get go was unmistakable. Lorelei was stuck in a self imposed rut raising her daughter and Jack was in a self imposed denial because of what his mom did to him. The push and pull was fantastic until the walls came crumbling down. From the beginning Lorelei put Jack in his place only problem was Jack opened his mouth before he thought which hurt her. Jack didn't realize he did because Lorelei was a first for him. As they continued to explore and push each other Jack is thrown into a situation way out of his control factor which helps open his eyes for a little while anyway. He refuses to admit anything until he thinks he might loose her for good. Being a strong independent woman makes her show who is boss. I found it hard to put this down. I wanted to see how Lorelei was going to put Jack on his toes and how Jack was going to stick his foot in his mouth. Not to mention little Hope...you know the old saying out of the mouths of babes....I could not put this book down I absolutely LOVED it and I am hoping we have more books on the other characters especially Garrett and Coco.
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"My dog got very bad diarrhea from just one treat. I had been using Vetri Science and she was fine  but  didn't love the taste so I  decided to try these. I'm going back to Vetri Science, they didn't make her sick.  I would like to say that for customer service I would give Paw Choice a 5 star. I was contacted by David and he generated a full refund without me asking.  The product seems to work for many pets, it just didn't agree with my dog's system."

You may ask why I continue to buy them, well, the double the price alternatives don't last any longer, nor do they sound any better. The band on these fit my head better than the more expensive Sleep Phones as well."

I look forward to reading more from this author.This was an excellent read. The characters were well developed and the story flowed nicely. I can't wait to see what happens next. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a good romance. I have a hard time putting down this book. I highly recommend this book.I absolutely loved this book.  I was just so excited to read it and read it again.  It was a sweet story.  It had a wonderful story line that kept you guessing until the very end.  I can't wait to see what happens with the other characters.  I received this book for an honest review.This was a really good read.  It was not a bad book, but it was not the end of the world.  It just left me hanging.

I loved the characters and the plot line.  I loved the way the author made the story line work.  I would have liked to see"

Kindle_Store_5,0,"In 1851, childhood friends Amy Stevens and Matthew Kane travel with their families in a large wagon train bound for Oregon. Matt has long known he loves Amy, but shes only ever harbored brotherly feelings for him. As the massive trek begins, Matt makes his intentions known, but Amy rebuffs him. However, once the seeds of awareness are planted, Amy discovers that her attachment to Matt gradually begins to change. When Matts vengeful brother starts trouble, Amy is forced to hide the budding relationship because Matt insists on protecting her reputation. With compelling and likeable main characters, colorful and well-drawn secondary characters, and immersive descriptions of the Oregon Trail, Ms. Trueax has crafted an epic novel that will pull you in, slowly but surely. You won't soon forget Matt and Amy, or their bumpy path to a happily-ever-after."

Electronics_5,1,"When they say ultra thin, this is the case.  I will admit that I have been using the same pair for the past three years.  The sound is crystal clear, and it's worth the price.  I have a pair of Sony speakers that I use for movies and for podcasts and a couple of others.  I also have a pair of Sony speakers for movies and podcasts.  I have had them for a few months and they sound great.  I have not had any problems with them, but I have noticed that the volume controls are not working well.  This is a huge plus.  I have a Sony laptop that has a volume control that is a bit less sensitive than the other pair.  The volume controls are not as easy to use and I had to go through several attempts to get the volume control to work.  I would recommend this pair of speakers to anyone who is considering buying a pair of Sony speakers.

To conclude, this is a great set of headphones for the money."

The plastic parts are also very light and easy to wash.I have had this product for about a year now, and it's been working great.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"I purchased this at Bed Bath and Beyond 15 months ago. It squeegees the glass very well, and the suction cup fixture stays up. (It detached just once, in the seasonal change from humid to dry weather.) No rust, and the rubber blade has stayed flexible. The folding design keeps the squeegee off to the side, out of sight.

Yet, I'm unhappy: the folding pivot point has loosened over these 15 months. If it was just a bit ""wiggly,"" that might be okay. However, the pivot and its fold-lock mechanism are obviously parting ways. The squeegee is no longer effective because the blade cannot be held perpendicular at the end of the swiveling handle.

My experience with this squeegee is similar to other ""simplehuman"" products I've used in the past. They look well-designed, with an aesthetic similar to Oxo and other neo-design products. But, their engineering has invariably incorporated flaws that eventually destroy the product's usefulness. I'll be replacing this squeegee with one from another manufacturer, and not purchasing from this line again."
Kindle_Store_5,0,I enjoyed this book!! Ill be getting more from this author!! I enjoyed the ending and the whole story all together!!
Kindle_Store_5,0,"It is just not particularly consistent.  A main character gets shot several times and survives hours on a train with minimal first aid.  The villain doesn't shoot him in the head or the chest? They come out of a forest to a train station that has only one stop and no one notices?  Neither main character can get their access card into the card reader, although they have been standing in line watching all the people in front of them insert the card.  The guards let someone suspicious approach them, even though they have their gun drawn?  The guy is planting explosives and not keeping them on a short fuse, so the bad guys, who are watching on video can disarm all ten to fifteen of them? I mean, please?  Sorry; only so many hours in my life.  Not enough to read the next two books.  This doesn't even get to any type of twisted issue with the villain causing a miscarriage as some type of revenge on the father."
Toys_and_Games_5,1,My first grader has been using this toy for about a month now.  He loves it and we have yet to find any issues with it.  The plastic is sturdy and it is easy to put together.  It is a great toy for the money and is still fun for the whole family.  I have also seen it used by kids in the bathtub and so far it has held up great.  I highly recommend it to any child who likes to play with toys.This toy is amazing! It's the perfect size for my little girl and she loves it! She loves it and it's a great size. She's a huge fan of the Disney Frozen.This was a gift for my son. I thought it would be a little more fun than I was expecting it to be.
Toys_and_Games_5,1,This puzzle is a big hit with my son and he has a lot of fun building this one.I bought this for my son for Christmas and he absolutely loves it. The only thing that I do not like is that the carpet is very thick. This was a big hit. He also had a lot of fun
Kindle_Store_5,0,"This freebie is so worth it. Is short and cute and meaningful. Tork is a homeless young man. I don't get to know the real reason why he is homeless or the real facts about what he endured while being on the street. But his POV had a poignant feel to it that make my heart ache for this lonely man. Adam is a college kid and a world class jerk. He involuntarily volunteer in the shelter in order to get a good reference for college. His had a super-sized ego, rude, selfish, narcissist and etc. I'm sure his character is suppose to make people hate him, but I just laugh it off as part of the humor of the story. Every week Adam reluctantly went to the shelter passing our food parcel, while internally hating the work. This is where he met Tork, the green hair exotic creature that he was not suppose to be attracted to. Anyway, when Tork try to evade Adam at every turn, Adam who suffered a bruised ego, decided to start 'The Invasion of Tork', which I find it extremely sweet and funny despite his motive. Later, Adam start to realize that Tork is more than just a no-good-doer homeless man. Overall, despite the short length of the story and the lack of character background, I love this book and wish it was longer. Seriously. Such good stuff shouldn't be so short. I appreciate the fact that although the pace seems slow, but there is a lot of heart to the story and it makes me cry a few times. I can't wait to buy the sequel now.

Movies_and_TV_5,1,"Eric's obsession with movies takes a back seat to the fact that he's also a serial killer, and is basically living the dream.

In the end, the movie is okay, but it's a little disappointing in some ways. The movie is a little slow to get going, but the story is pretty good, and it's a pretty good ending. I think the ending could have been a little more interesting, but I think that's a minor complaint.

Overall, if you like this type of movie, you'll probably like this one.  I recommend it.I enjoyed this movie and am glad I bought it.  I would not recommend this to anyone who is a fan of this series.  However, if you like the story, you will enjoy it.  It has a good story, but it is not as good as the other ""Home Movies"" on the list.  I have seen some of the movies that are on this list that I am not sure what the reason for the rating is.  For example, ""The World's End"" was a good movie, but ""The Fog"" was a little better.  I would have liked to have seen a different ending, but I found it a little too slow.  I don't know.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"Okay. I purchased 3 what I thought were different styles of arm covers, all black. Well, I got 2 Hi-cool and one something else. At least I can compare the two I bought. Hi-cool are far superior. I wear them for at least 8 hours and my arms do not mind! I am afraid of skin cancer and I am in the sun all day, so I bought these. Yes, they are bit warm, but not bad at all. They grip but not so tight you lose circulation (and I do not have skinny arms). They are so soft and comfortable. I wish I knew what the other ones were called, but I now know for a fact that Hi-Cool Rules!

06/2015-  Well, I ordered another pair and these are different. They are much thinner and seem shorter. I guess they are not all made the same. Just a heads up. The new pair is very uncomfortable because it is smaller and shorter.  Once you stretch it to fit, you can see through the fabric....hope it still protects me.  Buyer beware. All Hi-Cool are not the same."

The blade is a bit of a pain to operate, but it's not a problem.  The construction is very solid and the blade does not slip.  I have a few small holes in the plastic housing on the blade so I don't have to worry about it falling off.  The blade is smooth and a good value for the price.  I would recommend this saw to anyone.I love these lamps.  They are brighter than my old ceiling fan but still work great.  I love the way they dim to a bright white.

She is a bit small for her but she still enjoys them. We have 2 kids so I think it will be a great addition to our collection. This is a fun game for my son. He plays it by himself and I like that it's not too complicated for him to play with other kids. The only thing I'm not happy with is the fact that it has a few pieces.

I will buy another one for my phone.This is my second pair of earbuds, and I was skeptical at first.  I was looking for a pair that would fit my ears comfortably and not have the sound of the sound of the other pair.  I was disappointed.  This pair is not exactly comfortable for my ears.  I wish it had the built-in mute button, but I will have to look elsewhere.  I bought these to replace the earbuds that had been on the other pair I had before.

I am very happy with these.  They are well made, well made, well made, well made, well made, and I would recommend them to anyone looking to have a pair of earbuds that they can have on hand when going to the gym.  I will not be purchasing these again.  I had to return them because of the price.  I would be very happy to return them.  I really like the fact that these are plastic."

It's an entertaining movie, and I'm not sure if I would recommend it to anyone.  The movie itself is entertaining, the acting is good, and it's worth watching.  It's a very entertaining movie.  This movie is still worth seeing.  I recommend it to anyone who enjoys funny movies.  I hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did.Love it!I was happy to get this film back on DVD, so I can buy it again.  The editing is great, and the acting is great, too!  There is a scene where a young girl is at the end of the movie, and she is talking about how much she loves the movie, and how she loved it, too. "

Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"I originally bought these glasses on June 29th, 2016. At the time, I thought these were outstanding glasses and rated 5 stars.

Today, August 7th, 2017, one of the Bormioli Rocco glasses exploded spontaneously inside the dishwasher while it was OFF.
The glass was dirty and I was waiting to get more dishes to run the dishwasher. I'm totally surprised that this happened.

I'm lucky that it exploded while inside the dishwasher (minimizing broken glass all over). I don't think I will buy these glasses again as EXPLODING GLASSES are too dangerous to have around my family.

I just read other reviews of customers claiming these glasses also exploded on them.. I had no injuries but many others did.
Do not buy them unless you want to risk yourself and your loved ones with them."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"This is the worst purchase I have ever made from Amazon. I have had the mattress for several days, opened and laying on my bed frame. It is supposed to be a 6 inch mattress and won't inflate beyond 4 inches. I got tired of sleeping in a recliner and tried to sleep on this thing last night. After an hour of being completely uncomfortable, I put my old two inch foam topper on it and tried sleeping again. No go. This thing gives and doesn't bounce back. It's like sleeping on a board. I am sore all over after my two attempts at trying to sleep. I am contacting Amazon for a return/refund. Don't waste your time buying thing thing, even for a guest room -- your guests will hate you if you do! And, when it was opened, there was a stink in the room coming off the mattress. It off gassed for two days. I received this in Nov, 2017 and the tag on the mattress said it was made in China in Sept, 2016. So it was manufactured, then rolled up tight for over a year. No wonder it doesn't inflate. I am very, very disappointed in this. UPDATE: I returned the mattress to Amazon. There was no hastle, arranged for UPS to pick it up and the refund to my account was issued within 2 hours of being picked up. The hardest part about the return was rolling up the mattress (it was very stiff in the middle), tying it off, wrapping it up in the plastic it came in and then taping card board all around the plastic. I probably didn't have to do all of that but I did it anyway, just to be sure it arrived in one piece. Don't  waste your money on this product."

Electronics_5,0,"THIS IS A GOOD REVIEW (all negativity ends to be a positive ending), I give it 5 stars!

I had a MAJOR lightning storm that killed about 5 of my electronics, including my desktops network card, which is built into the motherboard. When I found out it wasn't working, I went searching on Amazon for a new one (since Amazons merchandise is always on sale, or just plain cheap, money wise) and found this. I kept a tab on this open and looked at other, but my decision came back to this because of how cheap it was, and the good reviews, AND a similar story to mine someone else said (lightning storm, built into modem, etc. ) When I purchased it, I completely forgot about it until it arrived today. I soon hooked it up, excited and all. As soon as I power it on, I got that Limited but No Connectivity. I went through EVERYTHING trying to fix it, over an hour and a half. Nothing. I went out and came back and still nothing. So I looked up online problems that could relate to this. After about 3 websites, I came across a forum comment saying to download a tool called WinsockXPFix, after opening this small app and 'Fix'ing it, it worked. And now I'm sooooo happy, enough to get back on here, and write a review. I also found that little app just replaces missing files old programs I uninstalled, took with them. I wrote about this program for others who have any network problems relating to this Limited but No Connectivity issue."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"I purchased this product because my dishwasher used to always fill up with calcium deposits.  I was cleaning it every two months when the screens and holes in the wands would clog up.  I also had hard water stains on the faucets.

I was very skeptical about whether the product would actually work.  The science is hard to prove!

I installed one of these items on my incoming water supply.  I thought I would start there and then move it to just the hot water side if I wasn't getting the results I wanted.  Since I installed this about 6 months ago, I have never had to clean any calcium from my dishwasher wands.  Yes, I changed out my dishwasher when I installed the Eddy but I really believe I have seen a difference.  I had decided I would spend my budget on the Eddy rather than a top of the line dishwasher since they all seem to clog with the hard water in my area (200 mg/L as CaCO3 or 12 grains).  It appears to have been a good decision for me.

I haven't yet had any problems with hard water so I haven't felt the need to move the unit to just the hot water pipe.

PS:  I installed the unit on my incoming copper water line."
Books_5,0,"Djilas was among the top leaders of the new emerging Yugoslav Republic after the Second World War. His voyages to Moscow were of extreme importance to Yugoslavian communists and for himself also. His very detailed accounts of his encounters with the leaders of Soviet Union are very interesting, but after his final visit, he begins to view things differently. I can say that I understand his point of view, but I can also  understand Moscow's attitude as well. If we are scientific enough to reject calling Soviet Union as ""imperialist"" I can move on, if not well...I do not call Soviet Union ""imperialist"" and place myself in their position. As regards to the Soviet Union the war took its toll immensely, the victory was won with awful consequences. One has  to be guarded as regards to foreign policy, one also has to think about his country and revolution primarily. When Djilas complains to Stalin about Red Army soldiers' bad behaviours, Stalin's answer shows his different perspective (to which I agree). He wants Djilas to understand that in real life things are complicated. He explains that they had to include all the men into the army, including all the convicts,so when a man fights for his life,walks for thousands of miles and sees his best friends die you can not expect him to behave as if nothing has happened. The problem with the writer is that his critics are very reasonable but when they amount to anti-communism they are not satisfactory. Djilas is convicted in Yugoslavia later for writing this book. I do not think he is an agent of imperialism but his works get attention in the West for its anti-communist views. All in all a good book worth reading but has to be supplemented with further readings on the post-war Soviet Union subject."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"Just ok.  It takes a lot of cutting to really chop a salad and it has a tendency to bruise spinach.  I suspect the double  mezzalunas would do a better job of chopping, however, I read that the food would get stuck in between the blades and I could see that.  You would need to have blades that were spread further apart than I could find to solves that problem.  I read complaints on the cover however, I have no problem with the cover.  I haven't attempted to sharpen it yet so I'm a little concerned about that.  However, it still beats hand chopping so I still recommend it if you like to chop your veggies for a sald."

Pet_Supplies_5,0,"I am very disappointed in this product.  And, I'm disappointed in myself for not calling Dremel within the first year of getting it and complaining.
First I'll describe my disappointment when it RAN:
--  its heavy
--  its noisy - scares both my dogs.  The less ""sophisticated"" pedi-paw is easier to use and not as noisy.
-- battery charge didn't last long.
Second, when it didn't run:
-- I'd plug it into the charger and into the wall.  It appeared to charge, but upon using it, within minutes it would lose power again.

In the 3 years since I originally purchased this product on Amazon, I have used it only a few times.  I just recently saw it in the ""dog grooming box"" and thought, ""Hey, let me try this again, before I throw it out"".  Plug it into charger and into the wall, and nothing.  No light, nada.

So I call Dremel Customer service and explain the general problem I've had with this product since the beginning and asked if based on these symptoms, it is the charger, the battery or both?

The answer was disappointing too.  No idea.  You'd think there would be some experience with this set of problems.
The cost of replacing both the charger and the battery is more than buying a new one at Walmart.
She did suggest sending it into Dremel and explaining and maybe they would do something about it.
I considered that, but spending another $5 or so on shipping for a product that really wasn't very good in the first place is just not worth it.

Maybe the product I received was a lemon compared to all the other great reviews out there.  But still, I found it way too noisy to be useful on an animal.

Dang, hate wasting money."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"DO NOT buy a Streamlight because you think there's a lifetime warranty, there really isn't. You have to read the fine print.

I bought and received a genuine Streamlight Microstream (NOT an imported knock-off), and have loved it while it worked. The problem I have with the company is their misleading use of the term ""LIMITED lifetime warranty"". Let me explain. Streamlight's ""LIMITED lifetime warranty"" doesn't apply to electronics, bulbs, batteries, or switches, just to what they deem as manufacturer's defects. So, basically, their so-called warranty applies only to manufacturing defects in the aluminum body-tube of the light. NOT COOL, Streamlight... you want us to ""Buy American"", but you have a crappily designed switch that wreaks of designed obsolescence.

Cost of a replacement tail cap/switch is $12 ($4 + $8 shipping), which is hardly worth it, especially considering that the LED emitter has been upgraded from 35 to 45 lumens."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"This is my second set of these glasses.  The first lasted over a year before I decided to replace them.  Of the several different types of glasses I have tried these were by far the best, they fit well, fogging was minimal, and the molding did not obscure my vision.  This pair however only lasted a couple months (used about half a dozen times) before a plastic film on the lens began to flake off making them unusable.  I spoke with Amazon, they would not refund or replace due to it being over 60 days.  They suggested I contact the seller.  The seller it turns out is only a distributor and I was referred to ESS to complete a warranty claim.  I called them and was told I could get a replacement lens for about $20.  I told them that was unacceptable for something that should have and has in my experience lasted much longer than a couple months.  So after a few emails and about a month of waiting I did receive a replacement lens at no cost.

I understand that periodically manufacturing errors will occur even on the best products but it's frustrating when nobody wants to rectify the problem. Overall I'm happy with the product but very disappointed that Amazon, Sportsman Supply, and ESS were so reluctant to stand behind this product."

Kindle_Store_5,0,"This was a good plot and I really enjoyed the beginning of the book as the plot began to unfold. A young 24year old girl, her mother has died leaving her to bring up her younger brother and sister. She finally begins her dreams of studying which will hopefully lead to fulfilment of dreams in the business world when she has an on and off attraction to her university professor.

It seems the young lady makes lots of assumptions along the way and it is a little difficult to understand how she comes to fall in love with the professor considering she spends so much time full of unwarranted anger with him. He on the other hand is like a typical male, thinking he is being considerate and all the time pushing all the wrong buttons. Except the right buttons that lead to an apparent pregnancy.

I shan't ruin the rest of the story. The book is well written, I think it would be nice if the heroin role was not filled with so much anger and assumptions, which leads the reader to feel there is a lot of 'love' that seems to be missing from this love story, however somehow it finds its natural ending. I would encourage the writer to write more as her style of writing is definitely very good and I did enjoy the opportunity to read this book. I would read her work again!"

Kindle_Store_5,0,"First let me start off and say I hate serial books. Totally hate them. However I did bite at Entwined for two reasons. One, it was free. Second, it was a Tarzan and Jane book. I have always been so intrigued with Tarzan and Jane and I thought there certainly isn't any harm is downloading a freebie from Amazon.

I wasn't disappointed but I also wasn't thrilled either. I would bet if I read this story as a full length novel, I'd have liked it a whole bunch more. One of the reasons I despise serial books is because each book leaves off on a cliffhanger and you are forced to buy the next installment to read on. I really really reallllly hate that. It is such a turn off for me. I'd rather have spent $5 and got the entire book than a grabby grab for a continuous purchases. Oh well, I knew that going in so I shouldn't really complain. Good on the author for letting it been known in the book blurb that it is a serial book before you buy.

The writing was really good. Great descriptions. Easy to follow and even though it was a novella, I got to know the characters pretty fast. Since it is an erotic novella, there are a few great steamy scenes. Of course you have to read further into the series to get the smoking steamy scenes.

Couldn't go wrong for a free purchase but the carrot that was dangled in front of my face at the end did not entice me to move on to the next book."

I got the other one for dry cat food so I could have my big plastic bowl back to use for people purposes.  I also wanted to make sure my 3 cats didn't run out of water accidentally like they sometimes did with the smaller plastic bowl I was using.  Not to worry....these hold lots of water and lots of food.  I highly recommend these."

The story was really interesting and I liked how the characters progressed through their lives. It was definitely a different story from the others.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"Brand new, the Spaulding 64-497 Official NBA Zi/O Excel indoor/outdoor basketball looks slick, and feels great in your hands.  The synthetic leather is very tacky, allowing someone with a medium sized hand, to palm the ball.  Along with a nice grip, the foam backing underneath gives the ball a cushiony feel, allowing for excellent control when dribbling.  This ball would be a very terrific choice for indoors , as the cushioning seems to make for a ball that is very responsive and lively.

With a softer outer layer, this ball doesnt fare quite as well outdoors.  Depending on the type of playing surface (concrete, asphalt), the ball can be a little less lively when dribbling.  Being sticky, it attracts dirt, and dust, and soon loses its tacky feel.  And playing on a hoop that has a steel net, probably isn't very healthy for the composite surface.

In conclusion, the Zi/O ball feels great, and would be ideal on an indoor court.  It can certainly be used outdoors, it probably won't hold up very well long term, under the more rugged conditions.  My choice for outdoors is&nbsp;, which is quite tough and very durable, Wilsons NCAA Indoor/Outdoor Tackified Synthetic Leather is also great, but seems to no longer be available."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Unit is plastic and seems to be well made. It easily fits on top of a 5gal bucket, but does not snap on or fit tightly.  Only when the vac is running does it ""snug"" down for a tight fit.  So, it easily comes off when not in use, which is aggravating.  Also, when hoses are attached, you need to have the bucket anchored in some way or it will be falling over every time you move one of the hoses.  Once the bucket gets to be about half full, then it becomes more stable.  None of that is really the fault of the product though, but is a result of using the product.

I am not overly impressed with it, but it works for the intended purpose.  Plastic holes for hoses don't look like they can take much abuse, so we will see how it lasts over time.  For the money, it is a good buy."

Books_5,0,"H. Paul Jeffers's biography of Grover Cleveland is readable, but I found myself thinking of the famous Walter Mondale phrase, ""Where's the Beef?""  Checking in at a brief 350 pages, made all the shorter by the interspersion of photographs throughout the text, this book is a good bare bones account of Cleveland's life in which the reader never really gets to know the man.  Cleveland is a vastly underrated President, mostly because didn't serve at a time of great national crisis.  So the recent interest in him (no less than two biographies published in 2000) is a good thing.  Jeffers's book did much to enlighten me, but left me wanting more.  I also found a couple of glaring factual errors.  Overall, Jeffers's book is a good introduction to its subject, and that's probably all most casual readers will want to know."

She almost looks too big for it (she's 2) or the product seems to not inflate all the way (but we've inflated it to the max, where it seems like it's about to burst).  She falls off easily and doesn't bounce well on it.  I thought it would be like the videos but instead of bouncing up and down my daughter seems to lose her balance on it quickly.  Maybe it's just because when I first gave this to my daughter she was still trying to balance out having a large head (don't toddlers look like cute bobble heads, lol) but her balancing skills are much better now.  I'll try to give it to her again and see if she can play with it more now.  Before she would bounce and go flying off the thing but I think she's gotten more skills at balancing the past 4 months and will be able to use this more in the spring.  I like it because it's adorable and seems like it will be a ton of fun once she gets used to the concept.  She really does have fun on it the times I let her play but I always have to put pillows around her and be on alert in case she falls.  As she gets older though she'll have a blast."

Books_5,0,"This series of books by ""Lemony Snicket"" does not have the standard ""happy ending"" of most children's books. The 3 kids in the stories (newly orphaned) have miserable lives with one thing going wrong after another. To make matters worse, their ""uncle"" - bad guy Count Olaf - wants their money and is always after them.  He and his evil minions are forever plaguing the lives of the Baudelaire children and cause constant mayhem.

Because of all this misery, I thought my 8-year-old son wouldn't like them - wrong! He absolutely loves them and is always begging me to read one more chapter! The writing is dry, but funny with loads of humor (much is directed to adults). The books contain many ""large"" or unusual words/expressions, but almost all are explained in the text (which can get annoying). I would say these books are good for kids from 7 - 14 (although use your judgement for the younger ones as the books do have evil bad guys, murder and lots of threats). As an adult reading the books to your kids, you might get a little frustrated as the stories are similar and the adults in the books are really dense - but these are for kids and they seem to love them!

The story is definitely moving along toward conclusion and we should have all the answers by book 13 (very appropriate!).  Readers will enjoy the series more if they are able to read the books in order as they build on each other - so this collection will be perfect for those new to the series - and the price is super."

Electronics_5,0,"I needed a updated router for more devices and stronger signal.  After a lot of research, I settled on the D-Link AC3200.  The router was very quick and easy to install.

So far I have two issues with the router:
1) During setup, I was given the option of changing the router name and password, but the changes would not process.  The install wizard just sat there no moving forward in the process.  I tried again with the same result.  I finally kept the factory given name and password (which in reality is more secure than the password I would have chosen).

2) Our devices randomly drops connection to the router, but will automatically connect about 1-2 seconds later.  So far, this has not caused any issues with streaming video/music/movies.  I need to research this more.  This may be caused by the router switching devices to a different band to spread the bandwidth demand evenly.

The router is considerably bigger than our old one.  This will require more space than you may expect.  This router is 15-21 inches wide depending on how you arrange the 6 antennas.  The suggested arrangement is to set the antennas at a 45 degree angle.  The router is 21 inches wide with this setup."

Books_5,0,"Lawrence of Arabia

T. E. Lawrence's work ""Seven Pillars of Wisdom"" is an early classic on guerrilla warfare by the author who trained, organized, and led Arab irregulars against the Turks in the Great War (WWI). The book, which was originally published in 1927 presents some principles of guerrilla operation which are still applicable today. Unfortunately, these principles are often lost in the author's obsession for beautiful prose. Fortunately, for the modern student of guerrilla warfare and insurgency Lawrence set down his thoughts on the subject in another work entitled ""The Evolution of a Revolt"" which is a must read for the professional warrior."
Movies_and_TV_5,1,"Alright! Finally, my favorite season of Star Trek ever!  I will admit that I thought this one was a little too long and I hated it. The beginning of the season was pretty much just a matter of the movie ending, which was a little long and seemed to be coming from the writers' imagination. I guess it just seemed like a lot of people were so bored with Star Trek. This season seemed to be pretty good. I don't know if I'm going to watch this again, but I will. I love the characters, the story, the special effects, the acting. I really liked the actors, the humor, the dialog. I just wish that they could have given the actors more of a chance to develop their characters. I would recommend this season to anyone. I really hope that they get a chance to add more episodes to the series. I really enjoyed this season of Star Trek."

When Learning Resources sent us the New Sprouts Cook It! My Very Own Chef Set to review and my son was really excited to get busy playing with it.

The Cook It! Set is a 6 piece set with easy to hold handles that are safe for small hands, it contains a  skillet, a pot, a lid, a colander and 2 serving spoons. It is a great way for little ones to pretend they are cooking without damaging Moms nice cookware. As you can see in the photo, my son was too excited to start cooking and he took off with the pot and colander as soon as they came out of the package.

I really like that this play set compliments his play food well. It is just the right size to pretend to cook with. It is durable and easy to keep clean, and it is the perfect size for storing without taking up too much space.

The Cook It! Set encourages imaginative play and it teaches kids to be nurturing.  Whenever my son pretends to cook something for me I praise him and thank him, he feels special and helpful and this is teaching him to think of others and to be helpful while he is having fun in the process.

I have been very pleased with this play set. I like the bright colors, I love that my sometimes too rough son has not been able to damage it and that he is learning every time he plays with it."

Books_5,0,"Desert Of Souls is the highly recommended first novel of an Arabian Nights-style series by the new author, Howard Andrew Jones.  As many other reviewers have already somewhat detailed the storyline, suffice it to say it relates the adventures of a scholar and the captain of the guard of a member in the government of Caliph Haroun al-Rashid as they go in search of a powerful magical tablet.  Being chased by an evil spy and a Magi, they encounter a lost city in the desert, a djinn, a desert of actual souls (hence, the title), and other beings and objects, natural and magical.

It's written in the style of the Arabian Nights but with an emphasis on the action-adventure of a sword-and-sorcery tale.  The author also conjures up new magical creations and beings not found in the typical Arabian Nights tale.

I'm anxiously looking forward to the next book in the exciting tales of the two intrepid heroes as they adventure across the Arabian Nights-style world of Howard Andrew Jones."

Well, add me to the list - this was fantastic for about 100 shots.  Really great concept.  Sure enough picked it up on day #27, fired 4 shots, then  no-worky -  it stopped lighting up altogether.  When I opened it up, could press the battery down and make it light - but will not light when the cap is on no matter how hard I press the little rubber stopper.

Changed batteries - no go.  Tried putting in a paper insulator as shown by one customer here - DON'T DO THAT!!!! with one layer of paper inside, you cannot remove the batteries again - no way to get them out.

Thank goodness for Amazon returns - this thing is going back right now....  I'll have to try Surestrike or other competing product instead.  But buyer beware - I have not seen a product yet with REALLY good reviews.  Seems like they must all be using cheap $6 Chinese laser pointers and charging $90 as a ""laser cartridge"".  Shame on you, Laserlyte - for the $90 I paid, I deserved more than 100 shots.  Won't buy from them again.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Thought I was stuck replacing my 30 year old vent unit due to bearing rumble in the fan motor. The local electrical shop said they couldn't find a replacement. Was more than willing to gamble on this as a replacement when I saw it. As others mention, the vibration isolation is not as good on this as it was in the 30 year old model so it's a little louder, but great compared to the bearing noiseI've been living with for years! My old unit had a stud that held the grill in place where this unit only has a hole. The clearance under the bracket made it difficult to find a bolt (used a panhead & filed it down) that would clear the motor.
It touches the motor and transfers Vibrations to the grill. I think sometime when I feel like messing with it I'll put a NutCert in the bracket and lock tight a stud into it, but for now it's fine and I didn't have to crawl around in the attic insulation to fix it!

Jagger comes from not so great of a childhood and Tatiana comes from a childhood of abuse, so they have something in common which is the crappy childhoods. And of course, it's what brings them together which is maybe what I found so cliche.

He's an ""underground"" fighter and has been in trouble with the law yet he is the one who gets in trouble because he tries to help her.

I don't want to do spoilers so the best I can say is - it's sad when you know exactly what direction a story is heading and you keep reading hoping every cliche won't be used.

He's a huge Nerf fan and I ordered it to add to his Nerf collection. He loves to shoot it with it and it shoots great! It's very durable.

It does play a lot of formats, but I've found that Divx or Xvid usually looks better if I convert it to a DVD using dvdSanta and watch it on the X-box. For your video files not worth a whole dvd, or to fit over 30 hours of 256k quality MP3s on one DVD, it does the job. Maybe with firmware it will get better. Also, its goes real jittery and even the menus flicker spastically if in progressive scan mode. The web site suggests turning off progressive scan mode, yet this is still advertised and labeled as a progressive scan player. Play a lot of stuff for cheap, but it shows. Especially DVDs....

Toys_and_Games_5,0,"I'm not the best at doing any kind of organized crafts with my children. My style is more along the lines of giving them art supplies and letting them create what they want, and honestly, that's what I'll always prefer for them. They really enjoy projects that have a somewhat defined end result sometimes, though, and so it's kits like this that come to my rescue. Thankfully, they still get to be a bit creative with these projects, and while end results might look similar for many children, they probably won't look just alike.

There are 16 projects within this box, with lots and lots of little pieces. There are only instructions for 5 of the projects, but really, with those instructions, you can easily figure out the rest of them. I would have preferred for each of the projects to have been individually packaged to make things easier. I have had kits like that, and they make things a breeze for this disorganized mama. This kit does need a bit more organization on my part, but it's really not that bad. The supplies are all separated into different bags, and there are even extra bags for me to divide out some of the supplies. I could turn my children loose with everything and see what they come up with, but I prefer separating each project(at least for the most part), so that my children can choose which one they want to do, and not worry about running out of supplies before all the project are finished. Between my 3 children, I'll get 5 rainy days out of this box, with one extra. (I can't beat that!) ;) Plus, the included finger crayons can be used after all the projects are finished.

This is a really nice box of crafts. Especially if you're like me, and don't do so well with organized crafts, this is an excellent way to give your children some fun with crafts."

Toys_and_Games_5,0,"This is a review for the Disney Princess's: Sparkling Princess Series Collection by Mattel and Disney. Overral this doll is very amazing!  The doll has a golden sparkly crown, (Instead of a bow, we are treated to a nice crown) overall the crown is very satisfying, I really like the extra sparkle in the crown. Snow White's dress is gorgeous as well, the top part is blue with blue sparkles along with a red bow on the end of the top, on the top sleeves we have a puffy part of the sleeve that is baby blue with red color as well added along with it, kinda like a pattern. Next on the bottom part of the dress we are treated with a yellow sparkly color, this part of the dress is probably the most sparkled part of the dress. What I really enjoyed was the cool pictures of apples made out of the yellow sparkles, In Snow White she ate a poisonous apple, which was why this was included in the outfit. But I eventually found out in the Sparkling Princess Mattel Barbie Collection is that they also included different pictures symbolizing parts in the treasured Disney classics in the other dolls as well. The last part of the outfit is the red sparkly shoes, which stay on pretty nicely. Overall I rate the outfit a 5.0. Other than the outfit we have Snow White herself, who in my opinion is one of the prettiest Snow White dolls in the Disney Mattel Doll Collection. She has brown eyes, (Doesn't have much makeup which actually makes her look even more pretty) plain black hair, and pink lips. The only thing that didn't appeal to me was the regular looking skin, which in the story she is described to have ""skin as white as snow"", which her skin isn't pale. Actually I bought the Cinderella Sparkling Princess doll as well and found out her skin was more pale. But overall it doesn't bother me. I rate the whole thing full five."

A person can buy this for themselves, also buy it as an e-book gift for someone else and at the same time bless the military children of deployed parents. A win-win deal."

Books_5,0,I really enjoyed this historical novel even though much of it had to be purely speculation on the author's part.  Michelle Moran did well in bringing the historical characters to life as she always does.  It was an interesting read with enough true facts to inform the reader about ancient Egypt as well. This book really sparked my interest in the current prospects that there may be much more to be found within King Tut's tomb that might relate to Nefertiti.

The Leviton web site says: ""HP Rating: 2HP-120V 2HP-240V-277V""  so the switch should have no problem with my compressor.  I installed it a few weeks ago, and it's been working fine.

They are very comfortable, very soft, and have a really nice feel to them. I wear them every day, and have worn them all day long. I can't say enough good things about these shoes. They're a great addition to any wardrobe, and they are a good fit and quality. I can't wait to wear them for a long time. Love these shoes. I love the color and the fit. This is my second pair of these, and I really like them. The material is good, but the sole is a little loose. The color is exactly as I expected. It's not as warm as the picture would suggest, but it's still nice. The heel is a little loose on me, but not a problem. The color is a little darker than the picture suggests, but that's okay because it's not too dark. It's a very nice shoe. The quality is nice."

*Review copy received from InkMonster Book Club

WOW!!!

I really enjoyed this book. It was not the best I've read in a while. There was a lot of action, and a little bit of romance in it. There was also some sex. There was also a bit of a cliff hanger, and I'm not sure if it was due to the ending or because I didn't want to put the book down.

I loved the main characters. They were very likable, and the sex scenes were hot. They were also a bit steamy.

I really liked the story. It was a good read. I'm not a fan of cliff hangers, and this was not one. It was a good read. I would recommend it.

I received an ARC of this book for an honest review.

I'm so tired of being, personal opinion here, ripped off by authors who have a greater opinion of their ability than may be justified. I believe in paying for the author's legitimate intellectual property. However, looking at prices some of the greater authors, ( Niven, McCafrey, etc), some are having delusions of grandeur.

I would not wear these with a bra underneath, because the material is too thick, but I would not recommend them. These are super cute and comfortable. I have wide feet, but they run a little small.

I have a 55 pound, three year old female pit - she usually wears clothes that have a back length of 20 inches, so the length of the X-Large worked well, but her chest is too big to allow the front velcro strap to close underneath her chest.

And those other ones lasted me for years.

I LOVE how adjustable it is. I can stand my bike straight up or put it at a pretty good angle without it tipping. I'm 6'1 and have a pretty large bike too.

Bottom line: It's worth the price."

Sure, but at this price point they're a good value."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"Bought this to try for reducing wind noise while motorcycling.  The directions were clear, and the product was easy to use.  I wound up using a little less than half of the mixed compound for each ear, and it worked fine.  The thing is they do not reduce wind noise much at all.  Had much better results with the ""shell""-type plugs like eargasm.  So while the product did harden fully and form usable plugs, I cannot recommend for motorcycle riding.  Also tried them off the bike, and in comparison to standard plugs they do not block as much sound for other activities like mowing the lawn.  They are, however, much more comfortable than standard plugs as they do not exert as much pressure on your ear canal."

Books_5,0,"All the hundreds of thousands of wannabe writers out there (including yours truly) and THIS is what gets published.  Granted, it's a great premise, its just terrible writing and saddest of all (judging by the success of this series) no one can tell the difference.  But by all means if you want writing that tells instead of shows, ideas that don't develop any further than it takes to read in a chapter about the length of a visit to the toilet and characters as memorable and charismatic as the physical paper they are printed on, don't delay, this is the book you've been waiting for.

On the other hand, it's only fair that I point out that I've seen the comic book version and it's perfectly suited for that medium, it works much better in that form.

I'm not here to bash the writer, her success or loyal fans, just offering a warning to anyone who might stumble across this review to reconsider before diving in.  Ms Hamilton is cackling all the way to the bank, I'm certain her writing has improved over the course of the series  and I certainly don't begrudge her success one iota.  I just didn't like her book, in a big way."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,"Received this saw yesterday and it has been working very well. I have a small shop and am a big fan of the saw, so I bought the saw to replace a 4-inch saw that had no sockets in the end. The saw is very compact and has a lot of power. I have a large shop and am very happy with it. It has great power and is great for most tasks. I am very pleased with it. This is a great tool for small jobs. It works well for smaller jobs. I'm not sure how long it will last but it does have a long life. It's a good tool. This is a very good lamp. I like it and the color is nice. It is bright and bright. I have it mounted on a 3/4 inch tree and it is pretty sturdy. I would recommend this to anyone. My only complaint is the mounting hardware is a little difficult to use. I used this as a small light and it is good. I was very disappointed with the price of this light. I received it on a discount. I plan to buy another one as a backup. This is a very nice tool. I was looking for a tool that could fit my old saw and it's a great tool. I was very impressed with the quality of this tool. It comes with a nice blade and a handy bit holder that is nice to have in the tool box. The bits are heavy and I like that they fit into the saw very well."

Electronics_5,0,"I love the look of the case. That is what drew me to it in the first place. The lack of space for optical drives didn't bother me one bit since I wasn't going for that anyway. Only reason it got one less star from me is because there is little space for cable management. Maybe I'm just not as good at cable management than I could be, but I just couldn't manage to route all my cables from the back. I'll keep working on it but then this is a smaller case."
Kindle_Store_5,0,"I love a good werecat/tiger shifter book, and Dawn Steele's latest serial is amazing. This volume of The Alpha Men's Secret Club continues Rust and Kate's story from the first book. The curvy woman is deep in the alpha's clutches, and things heat up as an old friend gets in between the two and makes things a proper love triangle.

Kate must wrangle with her feelings for the unreachable and powerful alpha shifter, or her classmate, who's genuinely sexy and possessive in his own ways. I loved the tension and explosive moments between all these characters. The story moves with a uniquely Dawn Steele energy and creativity that's hard to put down, even to take a well needed rest!

Can't wait to see how this ends. The twist at the end is pretty crazy and makes it a guarantee I'll get the next book!"
Pet_Supplies_5,1,"I bought this cat tree because it was the only one I could find that would fit my one cat.  I had to replace the cat tree every couple of months because it was so thick.  I still use it, but it was a little thin and heavy.  The cats seemed to like it as well.  I also love the fact that it is a strong enough material that it is easy to put on and off.  The cat tree is a perfect size for my small cat to sit on, where I can have a spot for him to sleep, or just sit on and play.  It is easy to put on, and the cats do not mind it much, as long as they are well-behaved.  It is also easy to"

Books_5,1,"It's a shame that with this book, the movie version of it was also a disappointment.  The story is not very good.  There are some things you can't help but care about.  A little romance in the end, but no real depth or depth to the story.  I felt like the book was going to be a bit over the top with a lot of sex.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys sex.I enjoyed this book, very much.  I have read all of the books by Will Eisner, and I was quite impressed with them all.  The book is short, and doesn't have a lot of action, but it is a good read for those who love a good mystery.  It's not a story of how it all started, but it's a great read.This is a book about a teen in the 60's.  It is a perfect addition to any library of books that you read.  I bought it for my grandson and he liked it.  I'm always looking for more of this type of books.  I would recommend this book to anyone.  The characters are well developed and the plot is well written."
Pet_Supplies_5,1,My dog is a hard chewer and she loves these treats.  These treats are a treat to give her.  The only thing I can say is that she does not like these treats.  I have been giving her a few of these for her and she still likes them.  I have to admit that I do not want her to be able to chew on them.  They are just a treat to give to her and she loves them.  I have been giving her these for about a month now
Movies_and_TV_5,1,"Not everyone falls in love with an island.  But I did.  The best part of the film is the crew's ability to both enjoy and wonder if the island is really there.  They both look at the land in a way that makes it seem like it's there.  They both realize that they are the most beautiful people on the island and that the island has all of the qualities that make it beautiful.  But the film is shot with a camera that is better than anything else in terms of sound, color, and camera angles.  The colors are just gorgeous.  And it's a beautiful film that doesn't fall into the ""dark"" category.  The reason I like this film is because it has such an amazing cast.  It's also a film that was made to show people the beauty of the island.  I never saw this film before and I was really not expecting that.  It's a great film.  But I really enjoyed it because of the boat scene that took place on the island.  The boat scene is the best part of the film.  It's a great scene"

Electronics_5,0,"I've had 4 of these speakers hooked up to an Acoustic Research center channel and subwoofer as a complete 5.1 system.  These speakers have very nice and clear sounds.  In the past, I've had the Bose, Acoustic Research, and Klipsch Quintet III 5.1 systems, and these Energy Takes actually produce the best sound quality out of all of them.  For some reason, I'd like to replace speakers once every 3 years or so to sample their sounds, as some do it with cars.  It's hard to describe the sound quality as opposed to be heard to experience.  But to wrap it up, these Takes are the best speakers of all the bookshelf systems I've had.  Of course, none of them could come close to my top-of-the-line JBL tower speakers, but those are tower speakers and they cost $4000 (even 10 years ago)."

We have a large cat who is pretty much a jack-of-all-trades, and she is very active and playful. The treats were a bit too small for her and she would not be able to chew them.

Kindle_Store_5,0,"I received The Skeleton Garden from Netgalley, Alibi, and the Chatterbox program in exchange for an honest review.

The Skeleton Garden is the 4th book in a series about a gardener who seems to have bad things, i.e. bodies, turning up around her. And in this book there are actually a few. Pru, the main character is a gardener working with her older brother on the large garden of an English home, when they start digging up the yard to find out why a tree didn't grow, they come across a WWII plane and a skeleton. Not much later in the same hole another body appears and the town is excited to find out who committed the crime or if it was an accident.

This book had a very slow start, I have not read the first books in the series, so I really didn't have enough background about the characters to really feel for them - and even through the book, didn't really feel for them either. So it was hard to read. Yes the book picked up when the bodies started appearing and the investigations started but overall I was not feeling it.

I love a good mystery and this book did provide a few, which was nice, but not having connected with the characters I felt that something was missing for me. But like I said if you read the other books in the series, that may add to the connection with the characters that I did not have."

The book is well written and in good condition.I absolutely loved this book! I was so excited to read it. I was also so excited to read the sequel! It is a great sequel to the first book in the series! I can't wait to see what happens next!This book was great!  I loved it!  I have been reading this series for about a year now and have enjoyed it so much.  I have read every one of the books in this series.  I had the same sort of love for the other characters as I did for the story.  I will be reading the next books in the series.This is a book about a teen girl who is trying to figure out who she is and who she will be.  There are a lot of secrets that she has to keep from the other teens.  Some of the kids are so scared to tell their secrets that they have to keep them from telling"
Kindle_Store_5,0,"4.5 Star Review
Kylie Wilson was in love with Marcus Stone until he abruptly left two years ago to pursue a career in snow skiing.  She stayed close to his twin brother Malcolm and over the last year, they spoke less and less about Marcus during their weekly phone calls.  One day Kylie received an invitation to the island of Eden and it was signed, The one who's always loved you.  Naturally, Kylie assumed it was Marcus.

I love the Invitation to Eden series.  The reader can always count on that ""feel good"" feeling at the end of the book.  Elena Aitken did not disappoint.  One thing you must remember about Eden is that the island always knows what you want and need, even if you have yet to realize it.  Kylie and Malcolm's story was very sweet and romantic.  I look forward to more from this series and this talented author.

""Dune Racer"" is a spin-off from the original Dune Race, which took place on a beach in the Pacific Ocean.

The vehicle is powered by a rotary propeller, and the two engine types are a rotary engine and a rotary engine with a number of small propellers. The engine is designed to ""overheat"" and ""plow"" the sand. The Dune Racer is not only a spin-off from Dune Race, but also a spin-off from ""Dune Racer"".

Dune Racer was created by Mattel, and Mattel has a history of making toys that are just as fun as their games. This was the first of many of the Dune Race toys that Mattel released. The Dune Racer was made by Mattel, and Mattel has a history of making toys that are just as fun as their games.

The only thing that I can say about this Dune Race toy is that it is very nice and interesting. I would recommend this toy to anyone. It is really fun to watch the sand come out of the Dune Race.

I received this toy as a gift for my grandson. He is 5 years old and loves it. He loves it. It is very easy to use and very easy to learn. He also loves playing with it and he plays with it a lot. I think it is a good quality toy.Very cute.  The hair is really cute."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Ok, a few hours earlier, I reviewed a fan that even had a speaker in it. It really didn't blow much air. So, I get home earlier today and this fan had arrived. So, i charged it all day. I didn't have much in the way of expectations. It doesn't have as many features. Let's see what features it does have, according to the manufacturer...

Features
1X Handheld palm sized portable fan, powered by a rechargeable battery (included) or by the provided micro USB charging cable via computer/notebook, car charger, power bank, 5V wall USB charger, 5v solar charger etc.
3 adjustable speeds plus an LED light on the side, perfect seaming, made of top quality ABS
Highly efficient yet practically quiet; powerful yet energy saving, perfect for your office, dorm, home etc.
Please make sure the battery is placed correctly inside the slot before you turn on the fan.
Best cooling effects can be achieved when you hold it in your hand. Great fan for when you are out and about.

I got home from work tonight and as soon as I saw the fan, I went straight for it. As soon as I turned it on, I immediately felt more are than the other fan on high. It had two more higher settings! And it also has a light, so if your power goes out, you have a fan AND a flashlight! I love this thing already! Five stars for this little powerhouse of a fan! Oh, and it's cheap too! The other fan was $30!

I received this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased opinion. It in no way influenced my review of this product. If you found this review helpful, please click the helpful button. It's nice to have the feedback  :)"
Pet_Supplies_5,1,This this is HUGE and holds up well.  The two large bowls are just the right size.  The top is a nice bright color and is easy to clean.  I would definitely recommend this product.  Highly recommend it.I have two dogs and this is the only litter box I have found that does not break down and is very easy to clean.  It has a very nice smell and does not smell like a regular litter box.  I will buy another one for my two dogs to get their nails trimmed.  I use this litter box with my two small dogs and this one with my two large dogs.  The one with the dogs is a little smaller than I expected but it is still well worth the money.This is a great product for getting your dog to go in and out of the crate.  I have a 10 year old Lab and he is not quite as aggressive as I thought he would be.  He is very active and has not gotten into fights with other people.  I have used this product for a few months now and he seems to be able to get used to it.  It is easy to set up and I can see how much it will help with his training.  It is also easy to clean up.  I will buy another one for my other dogs and they both like it.  I will definitely order it again.It's a great toy for our small dogs.  I like that it's made from solid wood and not heavy duty plastic. 
Movies_and_TV_5,0,"If you have ever taken an exercise class that has totally kicked your butt & you are looking to get that kind of workout at home - this is it!!  When you are done you know that you just did a serious work out. It's approximately 48 minutes of constant cardio that includes an active aerobic warm up and about 6 minutes of cool down & stretching.  I am in fairly good shape although I have some weight to lose and I find this workout an excellent challenge.  If you are just starting out exercising I would think that this would be a bit too much to take on although JM does show some easier versions of some of the exercises.
A note about JM - I have to admit that I have never been a fan of hers previously.  When I would see her on the Biggest Loser she would rub me the wrong way.  However, after trying this workout I am a big fan now!  She is one awesome trainer & is able to get that across even via video.  Some people have commented that she does a lot of talking during this video and that is true - but it doesn't really matter what she's doing....it's what you do that matters :)"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"This cookie sheet is a thin silicone membrane with a silicone covered metal frame and handles that is oven safe to 400 The baking surface dimension is not a perfect rectangle; the width of the edges measure 10 1/2 wide, the center 11. I was able to fit nine 2 1/2 cookies on a sheet; a standard cookie sheet will hold twelve.
When you take the baking sheet out of the oven you need to use the handles; if you grab the edges with your fingers under the membrane you will deform it and crack some of the cookies.  You do need to be careful with cleaning and storage because the membrane is vulnerable to puncturing.
Overall this sheet is well made and met my expectations for a non-stick silicone baking surface. But because of the size, care and storage I didn't find it to be as useful as I hoped.

Books_5,0,"If you enjoy reading the world of Harmony this won't be an exception.  I've enjoyed these books and realized along the way I missed this one.  This is a short story, set pretty early in the series.  Virginia is a para-archeologist and Sam is a ghost hunter.  They have decided to merge their businesses and enter into a marriage of convenience (MC) but Virginia is getting cold feet.  She has feelings for Sam but he only seems interested in business and she isn't sure she made the right decision when she agreed to the marriage of convience.  Sam has actually has feelings for Virginia but he thought his best shot at a relationship was starting with a MC.  Their first business deal together as a partnership brings trouble and danger to the couple and now Virginia and Sam must work together to stay alive and survive in the tunnels of Dead City.  Sam has to convince Virginia to stay with him not just in business but forever and keep her safe.  This has all the trademark romance, humor and fun of the Harmony series and I really enjoyed it.  A quick, light read."

I was skeptical but he was fine.  The vet said if it's too small, the vet will tell me to try something else.  I got this for my other cat and it seems to work well.  I have a 60 lb. cat and it is a little too big for him.  I will definitely continue to try it out.  He has had it for a couple weeks and it seems to be doing great.  I am hoping that I can see how well it does.I bought this for my Yorkie and it works perfectly. It has a good amount of room for him to stretch out. I will be buying another one.My dog is a big chewer and I thought this would be a good toy for him. Unfortunately, he was just too big for my 18 pound dog. She loves to curl up and lay down on it.

I have tried many other toys, including these, but this one is by far the best. My dog loves this one. I love that it is made of plastic, but it is very sturdy. It is so sturdy, I feel confident in the durability of the nylon side.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"I was in love with this LED bulb until today when I took a multimeter to measure the current draw and calculated the wattage.  It turns out this bulb consumes about 8.0 Watts!!!  That's a far cry from the ""3.6 watts"" claimed on the package.

G7 Power no longer sells this bulb on their website and I wonder why.

This bulb was not the first to misrepresent the energy savings and won't be the last, but I'm just surprised at the big discrepancy.

CFL bulbs are the worst offenders when it comes to exaggerating the actual energy savings.

Some examples of the bulbs I have at home:

G7 Power ""3.6W"" vintage LED actually uses 8 watts.
A no-name ""23W"" CFL actually uses 43 watts
An Ecosmart ""14W"" CFL actually uses 24 watts
A Sylvania ""9W"" CFL actually uses 18 watts
A ""10.5W"" Philips LED bulb actually uses 21 watts.

Most LED bulbs I have are quite accurate in stating the watts, but there are clearly exceptions. The Cree bulbs I got are accurate in the stated vs. actual energy usage.  All my incandescent bulbs are very accurate in the stated energy usage."

Electronics_5,0,"It does what it says - it provides a stable mount for up to two 2.5"" drives in a regular internal hard drive slot. Here are the problems:

It's not compatible with the newer ""toolless"" cases that use posts rather than screws to secure the hard drive. The posts will not fit through the holes. Luckily, thermaltake does provide all the screws you need - just pop the posts out of your hard drive tray or mounting bracket and replace with the larger of the two sizes of screw they provide.

It is also difficult to access the screw hols for the lower of the two drives in this mount. If you need to mount two drives, do the lower one first, and find a small screwdriver.

Finally, the connectors for the hard drive will be recessed about one inch into the bay compared to the rest of the drives. If you have a small or a very populated drive bay, it will be difficult to access those connectors, and if you have the angled SATA connectors, you will not be able to connect two drives in this bay, at least one drive will need a straight SATA connector.

I only needed it to mount one hybrid SSD/HDD, but I do like knowing that even though it will take some effort, I can mount a second 2.5"" drive if I need to."

Pet_Supplies_5,0,"We have 4 cats. They all seem to love this litter. They go in, dig around awhile, do their duty and then they spend a more than usual time scratching around in the litter box before they exit. We, at first, though that it was because they were having a difficult time covering up their duty with the light litter. We were wrong. We have two litter boxes downstairs (and two upstairs) sitting side-by-side so we performed an experiment on the two downstairs litters. We put light litter in the left hand box and clay litter in the right. In the morning we filled one litter with their usual clay based litter and one with this light litter. The cats used them all day. At the end of the first day the box with the light litter was used about 30% more than the clay. On the second day the light litter box was use almost exclusively. There were only a couple of pee clumps in the clay litter. On the third day we reversed the positions of the two litter boxes. Now they were clay left and light right. Only the right box (light litter) was used all day. The clay litter box was clean! Both upstairs clay litter boxes were pretty much unused except for some pee. I have since seen the cats standing in line waiting to use the light litter box while the clay litter box was being left unused and completely vacant. Darndest thing I've ever seen. Now we're putting clay in the bottom and light on top until the clay is gone. From then on, light litter ONLY. Oh yeah, the light  litter does not track-out on the cat's paws and then onto the floor nearly as much as the clay litter. This makes my wife very happy."

There was a lot of action, and a little bit of romance. The characters were well developed and the storyline was full of action. I liked the fact that it was free, and it was a free book. I just didn't care for it as much as I did the other books I read. Overall, I liked this book. I really enjoyed this book, it was a little confusing at times, but it was a good book for a short story. I read it in one sitting. I'll be looking for more by this author. I love this series, and this story is awesome. It's a great story about a strong woman who is determined to be happy."

Books_5,0,"This is genuine adult fantasy at its finest. I don't mean it is pornographic, though there are sexual elements presented within reason. What I mean is that Bakker does not try to beat around the bush here. His characters are flawed, in fact here perfection is defined as the ability to manipulate others. The most likable characters are often the weak ones, but it is in fact this weakness that gives them compassion for others. There are no definite good guys, even those seeking to battle against the apocalypse are suspect. After all, if you are fighting for such a worthy cause isn't any evil excusable?

And if all men and women are manipulated by their emotions, their past experiences, is it really a crime to use them or hurt them? Are they not machines? These are the questions Bakker poses in the course of the novel, which is filled with political intrigue, military conquest, and realistic love stories. What I mean by realistic is that there are no virgin princesses, no knights in shining armor, but rather imperfect people loving each other. This is definitely one of the more honest fantasies that has come down the pipe in quite some time."

I was thinking about going with this camera and decided to buy a Canon 2D with a 2D sensor.  I have had several Canon 3D cameras and I just can't get enough of them.  The 2D sensor is perfect for me.  I have had no problems shooting the 3D, I shoot with my Canon, not with the camera.  The Canon 2D is great for the price.  I have not had any issues shooting 3D on this camera.  The only issue I have is the battery life.  I have had a 3D camera for several years now and have had good battery life.  I just wish the 2D was a little longer but I am happy with this camera.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"The big question is: ""How does it compare to paracord?""  My situation is that paracord is just too bulky for my uses.  I'm aware of the advantages, which are the inner strands that can be used for fishing line, sewing thread, etc.  And for those applications, I continue to carry a little paracord.  BUT the spectra speargun line has become my primary use line for tarps, and tying large and/or unexpected things to my motorcycle.  This line is rated at the same strength as paracord, but is much thinner, which equates to far less bulk and weight for the same length.  Now, an argument can be made for cost.  Yes, paracord is much cheaper.  But for me, I just need a little paracord, and 30 feet of this, and I'm good to go.  I feel that Spectra is extremely durable, so I don't expect to need to buy more in the near future.  Now, one might wonder: ""If he is so concerned about bulk, why not buy some really thin nylon string?""  Well, I did... and it worked great for a single use.  Doing anything other than rolling it back up on the dispenser, or around a board, etc., results in massive spiderwebs, knots, and tangles.  I'm trying to be a green guy, so I try to avoid single use things.  And now, the final question:  ""This is speargun line.  Why is this guy talking about backpacking, motorcycles, and camping (bushcraft)?""  I am a scuba diver, and I do have a speargun, but I just feel better about fishing with a rod and reel... so I won't be using my speargun.  I can tell, however, that there would be nothing better than this, if I were to."

I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. I would recommend it for anyone with an iPhone. Great for the price. I have a portable player and I can use the external controls to control the volume. I can set the volume to a level that is too loud for a person to hear. I have a second player that I use for music and I can also control the volume by either a knob or by turning the knob on or off. The only problem I have is that the sound is too weak and the sound is loud. It is a bit noisy to hear, but it's a good speaker. I have a pair of Bluetooth headphones that I use in the car and they are very good. The sound quality is excellent. I use this in my car and it sounds very good. I have used it for a while and it's been great. I would recommend this product to anyone. I bought this keyboard for my daughter and she loves it. It's a little smaller than the typical keyboard, but it's a little lighter than she expected. It works really well for my needs and is well-made.

Pet_Supplies_5,0,"We were feeding this to our two puppies (Goldens) for the past 7 months. At first they seemed to like it okay and then all of the sudden the last bag of food they weren't interested in it at all. Matter of fact, as hungry as they were, they would leave their entire bowl of food, untouched all day long. Only at night would they eat a TINY tad, only enough to basically sustain life out of starvation. One of the puppies started looking thinner and mind you, these ""puppies"" are already between 60-65 pounds each so I know they had be hungry. I started doing my own research on the food to try to see if others were experiencing this behavior with their dogs also. While I hadn't been buying this food on Amazon, I was buying it at our local pet food store, I still feel compelled to let everyone know that consumer affairs has a lot of complaints about this food, with the same exact symptoms as a lot of people on Amazon have and the same as we had with our two puppies, refusing to eat and loose stools. I returned the last bag I had purchased from the pet food store today and replaced their food with ""Zignature"" limited ingredient dog food and let me tell you, these dogs tore it up!! As soon as I sat their bowls down they started gobbling their food up. No I am not an employee of Zignature or paid by the company, this is just my honest review. So if your dog's refusing to eat or only nibbling at their bowl of TOTW and have loose stool or diarrhea, you may want to think about changing foods. Look up the consumer complaints yourself."

Electronics_5,0,"I've owned this wireless mouse for 3 years now, and it worked wonderfully for the first year and a half. This is a good wireless mouse for your notebook. It is small and easy to stuff into a pocket. I like the feel of this mouse; it fits snug in my hand, and doesn't feel cheaply made. The battery life is about 1-2 months if used daily. The scroll, I think, is the best part of this mouse. The quality of the scroll is good, and coherent with your actions. The reason i'm giving this a 3 stars is because the signal of the mouse got much worse over time. I was be able to use this 10 feet away without a problem when it was new, but after a while, it became choppy and would disconnect even if I were a few inches away. All in all, this is a good, cheap wireless mouse that is acceptable while it lasts."

Electronics_5,0,The camera is amazing in every way except for that it has a noticeable shake on the outside edge when shooting in 4k mounted on a tripod. This is a very well known issue with this camera and they claimed to have fixed it with a firmware patch but after applying the firmware the problem still remains. Even when you disable the steady shot feature it still happens so something else is causing the optics to vibrate inside of the camera. Sony has been little help so far with correcting the issue and even claimed the couldn't tell when I sent them a video clearly illustrating the problem. The truth is the issue isn't that bad and you have to 'notice it' and in all honestly the other features of the camera still make it my primary camera with anything I shoot for Barnacules Nerdgasm on YouTube.

It transfers all the signals for all the speakers from my DVD player to my 5.1 receiver with no problems.

Books_5,0,"This book contains 90% very accurate descriptions of characters and personality of the 12 chinese signs x the 12 western signs. I got this book many years ago, and it is accurate when I read her readings for my father, sisters and friends. I would say I find her description to be 90% accurate, I think the 10% deviation may be factoring in environmental influence (eg. if she says this person likes to dress up or vain, but sometimes if the person is brought up in a family or culture that doesn't support that, or if the person is not physically attractive, they may do the reverse from low self-esteem etc). But nonetheless, her description of people's personality and character is usually very spot on.

I used her book to read several of my girlfriends, it is incredible. The ones Suzzane say that are loving, kind natured, nice,- they are indeed very nice and loving! The ones she says are cheerful and humourous- they are indeed those who like to laugh and joke! She said my father's sign is a 'born winner', she is right too, for my dad worked from a job of a teacher to become a multi-millionaire investor and director. She said I'm the sincere and serious/hardworking type,and I make a livelong good friend, well that's also true as I have many friends whom I knew since kindergarten and primary school!"

The smaller ones are a bit on the small side and don't seem to have the strength to hold up with the weight of the larger ones.  They are a little heavier than I expected.  I would not buy them again.  The Catit Jumbo is a better value for the price.My dog is a chewer.  He loves it, but I have a problem with it being too long for him to chew it up.  I bought another size for a different dog and he's a 5 pounder.  This size fits him perfect and I like it.  I wish it had been a little longer for him but he doesn't like it.  It was too big for him to chew on it and it was too big for him to chew on the handle.  I would have given it 5 stars but it didn't fit him well.  I will have to keep him from chewing on it because he is very picky and doesn't like having it on all the time.I have a Border Collie who is a mix.

The bat is designed to be a little too cold, so it's not ideal for a bat like this. I wish it was a little thicker, but I don't think it's a bad idea. I'd be more inclined to buy a heavier bat. I just wish there was some kind of ""blinking"" on the bat when I got it, and if I got one I'd be happy. I'm happy with it, but I'm a little concerned about it being too soft.

What's more scary then the movie is the people who gave this film 5 stars. 48% of 50 some reviews gave it 5 stars?!? How is that even possible that at least 25 people on this planet, and I know there are more, think this is as good as such horror films that generally get 5 stars from fans and critics like Halloween, A Nightmare On Elm St, The Exorcist ect... Obviously there is a second edit of this movie floating around that I'm not privy to. A edit that incorporates everything that makes a 5 star horror film. Gore, suspense, good acting ect.....

Movies_and_TV_5,0,"The movie's time frame, setting and plot are all similar to Command Decision, another fine wartime drama about air combat. But this one features a different cast and much more action. Gregory Peck plays Brigadier Gen. Frank Savage, who is given a critical task. In 1942 in England, early in World War II, he must restore the effectiveness and morale of the men of the 918th bomber group while replacing their beloved commander, Gen. Keith Davenport (Gary Merrill). The way he does so is tremendously difficult for both him and his men, but given what's at stake - possibly the outcome of the war - you can see that he has no choice. This movie was cited most often by members of the U.S. 8th Air Force as the most accurate representation of their lives and missions dramatized on film. Written by Beirne Lay, Jr. and Sy Bartlett from their novel, it is an intelligent, highly thoughtful portrayal of the stresses of command in wartime, and it's a tribute to the quiet but amazing heroism of the men who flew bombing missions against Germany. The 12-minute combat sequence featuring B-17 bombers against Messerschmitt and Focke-Wulf fighters is incredibly harrowing and more realistic than anything else on film - because it is real battle footage. Dean Jagger won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Peck's top aide, and Peck himself is terrific, as are Millard Mitchell as the Air Force commander in England, and Hugh Marlowe (in possibly his best role) as a trouble-plagued pilot.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Phil-s-Favorite-500-Loves-of-a-Moviegoing-Lifetime-2014-edition/dp/B00HU8VK4K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Phil's Favorite 500: Loves of a Moviegoing Lifetime (2014 edition)</a>"

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"I do not order articles of clothing unless I have tried them on in person. I have a difficult time finding clothes that fit. I decided to order this dress and crossed my fingers. I have never been more surprised at the fit!

I ordered the black dress with a red edge/outline on the neck and bow. The dress arrived quickly thanks to Amazon Prime. It was packaged in a plastic bag. I definitely would recommend upgrading to the gift-wrapping service if you are sending this dress as a gift.

I removed the dress from the package and was happy that I did not smell anything weird. I worry with less expensive items that they smell like chemical. This is not the case with this dress.

The dress is an excellent fit. I cannot believe how good of a fit. I normally wear a 12 (US) and I ordered the XL. I also was happy that I can wear my normal bras with this dress and the straps do not show, seriously, look at the pictures. The bra is not visible!

I am happy with the purchase so far but will update this review if there is an issue. I may only use this a couple hours on a date night so use is infrequent.

I am not connected in any way to this company but I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion. I use reviews myself when shopping online and I hope this is useful information for you. Don't hesitate to ask questions and I will update if there is a problem in the future. Please see attached pictures if you would like to see the coolness factor up close."

My only complaint is that the tiny seal that the air can tube fits against wears out too quickly and I have not figured out how to replace it (or get a replacement part).  The company says to buy a new sensor assembly which they will sell me for more than I paid on Amazon for the whole thing."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"This works great if you follow the instructions.  I like the bottle with the injector tip for applying the product more liberally to carpet.  I don't buy this small bottle though.  I buy the gallon bottle and refill the smaller bottles.  I had a dog with bladder stone issues and recurrent UTIs, so I had puddles from time to time.  Some were fresh, some had time to soak in.  Worked like a champ in both cases! This certainly worked better than Natures Miracle, IMHO.  But be sure you read the directions...or it won't work so well.

Movies_and_TV_5,0,"I waited for this movie to come to Richmond, Va. I didn't, much to my dismay & disappointment. I invited both my daughters, who hadn't read or seen this movie, in any form, to watch it with me.
  A spectacular, stunning display of wonder unfolded before our eyes. Even the proper use of the English language was not a barrier for my daughters, to understand this play of the master, Shakespeare. The music was otherworldly, transporting the spirit, as the story came alive, weaving its magic before our eyes.
  For me, this will be the role of a lifetime for Helen Mirren. She brought to life the gifted sorceress. Her acting was bold and powerful, and at the right moments, soft & tender. Her magical spirit Uriel was played to perfection by Ben Whishaw.
  See this movie! You won't be disappointed, but be struck by its beauty and power, to lift your spirit also to soar."

I used the double sided tape to put it up on the garage wall above the dog food and it doesn't seem to matter who feeds her, we all consistently remember to slide the tab.

Pet_Supplies_5,0,"The kabana does cover the litter box on all sides but I'm not impressed for the cost.  The instructions for assembly were not as clear as needed.  It is not sturdy.  Our cat took a leap on top of it ONCE (never again) and the top pole is noticeably bent.  Granted, it's not supposed to be jumped on; in hindsight, the cloth tent is not a good option for cats that are naturally going to jump on surfaces.  Also, the sides of the litterbox lid get stuck on the sides of the tent so opening the lid is not smooth.  The window at the back of the tent that is supposed to allow you to get to the buttons and settings is a joke.  Not only is it difficult to see what the settings are, but there's no way you can stick your hand into the tent AND see what you're doing at the same time.  It does allow the cord to be plugged but there's no other benefit to the window.  I haven't decided what we will try next but this purchase is a bust."

He's also the youngest one in the house and it is a little challenging for him to hold the pieces together. I think it is a nice toy for a little one, but not for a grown-up. The little one will probably love it for a while. I would buy this again, but maybe for a few more years. My son loves this car!  It is very well made and looks great on the wall. It is easy to put together and it is a great size!  My son loves it!My daughter loves this. She loves to play with it, but not the perfect size for her.

The only thing I would change is that the size of the drive is adjustable.  I would also have liked to have a USB 3.0 hub, but the hub is not compatible with this unit.  I just installed a new SSD and the drive is on and running with no problems.  The drive is very stable, and I have no problems with any of the features.

Kindle_Store_5,0,"Another great book of Katie and Tyler's love story. They are finally back together again and living together in California. Trouble finished their European tour and Katie and Tyler talked all the time and skyped every night. Now that they are back together again and more in love, things are going to take work and nothing worth anything will be easy. More secrets are revealed and they both have to live with mistakes they made and things that happened.

Katie hasn't always been Ms. Responsible or Ms. Perfect. She's lived her life and made some mistakes but she's never done anything intentionally to hurt anyone. She has a good heart and she cares about the people in her life. Her love for Tyler is all encompassing and she just wants to make him happy.

Tyler has a really screwed up past and he's had problems for years of trying to get past it all. He's done so many drugs and almost died on many occasions. But his love for Katie makes him want to be clean and have a life with her. He's trying to find a way to work where his problems with his hands don't interfere.

Definitely worth reading and looking forward to more of their story that comes out in January."

Pet_Supplies_5,1,"My little guy can't handle it. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the one we bought had a very small plastic part. He is a very tall boy, and weighs about 5 lbs. It's not a large toy, but it is very heavy for him. He also gets a lot of treats, and it's a great way to keep him occupied for a long time. I would recommend this toy to anyone with an older dog.my puppy loves this toy.  it is very durable and works well.  he does not seem to mind it at all.  it has a nice bounce.  it does not fall off the top.  he is a very large dog and loves it.  it has a nice bounce and he does not mind falling off it.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,I love these boots so much!!! I bought them for a Halloween costume and I wear them everyday!!
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Well to start with I really wonderd if this tool was going to save me time removing 75 years of paint on my mother in laws house. I orderd it and went right to work with it,about 3 days later I had a large old ranch house down to bare wood and ready for priming. I found that the house had been at least 7 different colors in it 75 years. When using the the stripper  I also used a full face shield and a resperator along with a long sleeve shirt and I put a bib on so that i wouldnt have paint going down my shirt. I also found that the metal disc. would sometimes clog with paint, so I would take a propane torch and burn the paint of the disc and then continue on. I did end up wearing one disc plum out and so I bought a new disc to finish up with. The stripper is a little heavy and your arms are going to get tired but my wife used it after I suspended it with 4 long bungee cords above the location she was working. The bungee cords helped suspend the tool and take the weight off the user. Anyway, the tool is very well made and plenty powerful and it beats trying to use an acid stripper. I will probably use it next to strip the paint off the cabinets in the old house and then make new doors. I can see where a home owner buying an older house could really save alot of money buying this new tool. I build high end custom furniture so i really nit pick my tools not only in there upkeep but in their performance as well and i don't keep any tool that doesnt perform. This new Porter Cable does perform very well and I feel that if your need is for a tool like this the Porter Cable stripper is the only way to go. No more messy & expensive chemical strippers."
Kindle_Store_5,0,"This is the same story as Jag but from Roxy's POV. There is a lot that you learn about Roxy and why she is the way she is. It really awesome to see things from her POV which made for a more well rounded story. She really is a strong person and I really admire her.
Jag and Roxy are definitely a unique couple. They started out basically hating each other (or close to it) and it basically boiled down to several chance meetings where they poked at each other. This was extremely amusing to read about. Jag has serious drug problems and unfortunately a huge part of that is is rock career and the people in it that put a lot of pressure on him. Not to mention his ex-girlfriend from before he became famous. Roxy grew up with a drug dealer father and brother who OD'd so she's seen that side of things and wants nothing to do with it. She turns out to be Jag's saving grace and the light at the end of the tunnel so to speak. Despite all their personal problems, they truly are a fantastic couple.
I loved how raw and emotional the story line was. It felt like it could be one of those documentaries about a real life situation. I felt deeply invested with the characters and hoping for a good outcome. It's definitely not for those that like all the flowery words and a perfect story because it's far from that. But in it's own way it is perfect because of all they both had to endure. I absolutely loved this book and I can't wait to read about the other band members. 5 out of 5 stars!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"This is an awesome set. Precisely cut decals with evenly distributed adhesive. Peels well (save for small items requiring nifty fingers).

Toys_and_Games_5,0,"My in laws got this for our son who is one this Christmas. He absolutely loves it! I put together a pros and construction based on my opinion:

Pros:
- it has three different paths it'll take depending on which position the rail switches are. This keeps it entertaining.
- very easy to put together. The instructions are very simple to follow. It is a little time consuming because you have to screw in nails about 15 times or more throughout. It probably took me about 30 minutes.
- it is well structured. I'm not too worried about it falling apart anytime soon. My one year old is pretty rough with it and it doesn't even flinch.
- comes with two cars (one boy and one girl). You can also use different cars to that you may already have like hot wheels and the smart wheels cars. Our kids have all kinds that they use.
- Even my 5 year old enjoys it. Sometimes I have to remind her that she needs to let her little brother play with it.
- No batteries needed! We all know that's always a plus.
- let's kids use their imagination! Any toy that allows kids to do this is a plus for me.

Cons:
- It is a bit large. We live in a apartment and this takes up a lot of space. It's about 37 inches tall and 18 inches in width. If you have the space, won't be an issue.
- It doesn't have two entrance paths so the cars can't race. This didn't seem like a big deal but my 5 year old has been taking about this, so I thought I would add that in here.
- There's a lot of pieces when building so for some it may be overwhelming. Don't worry the pieces all are numbered and colored so very easy to identify when building.

Overall, I would highly recommend this toy for little children. Even adults can have fun with it."
Kindle_Store_5,1,More of Brett and Evvie!!  I love the way they are able to make each other feel and to get to know each other. 
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"I have teenage boys, 3 big dogs, and 2 cats.  I vacuum daily, and I'm hard on my vacuums.  This is my 3rd Hoover Wind Tunnel variation... and I like it the best, and the suction is fantastic, but it is heavy.  Heavy to carry, heavy to push.

THE GOOD:
+ Fabulous suction pulls up all the pet hair you didn't want to know you had.  ""Multi-cyclonic"" suction; previous model was ""Dual Cyclonic"".
+ 7 settings for carpet height.  The previous model (Wind Tunnel 2 Pet Plus) had 5. Not sure that you need 7 but I guess some houses do.
+ Retractable cord - same as the previous model but longer by 3'.  Love this.
+ Rinseable filter and ""one button"" cup emptying (more on this in The Bad).
+ A great hose which, like on the previous model, 'clicks' to pull out/put back so you know you've got it replaced correctly -- but this hose stretches 5' more (to 15').  Great for stairs and ceiling fans!
+ 3 onboard tools (+ standard telescoping wand)... I like that they stay ON.
+ Wider (15"") head.  This is good and bad in my opinion.  You can get big rooms done faster but it doesn't fit under some things.
+ Folding handle!  Great!  Now fits in the closet!

THE BAD:
- Not 'steerable' - though I didn't take off for this as it doesn't say it is
- HEAVY!  Heavy to push and to carry,
- ARGH.  I still hate the cup-emptying!  I don't know how to solve this but I'm not an engineer and presumably someone at Hoover is  It's true you just hold the cup over the trash and push one button BUT the door swings away as the dirt is falling out...meaning that the door gets covered in dirt and is awkward to clean off as it hangs, swinging and spreading gunk, over your trash.

BOTTOM LINE:
GREAT for pet houses, lots and lots of suction and conveniences... might be too heavy for an older person."
Books_5,1,"As usual, Lee Child just keeps on running with the story. The story starts out pretty typical."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Very pretty....BUT...it's difficult to clean without streaking.  First you disinfect, then you use windex to remove streaks from cleaner.  Also....it shows every bum print!!!!!!!  :("
Books_5,0,"Great story. Classic Leonard style. Gritty, simple prose that has power way beyond the words. Read it and enjoy it."
Toys_and_Games_5,0,"OK, so first of all, as a calendar: I was annoyed that the numbers were all out of order. This made things difficult to find. I was also annoyed that the pictures on the front seem to indicate what will be behind which door, but then they weren't accurate. Now, all that said, it was nice that each door had a compartment tray behind it, and that they doors had directions on the back of the paperboard for each one. Each bag was also labeled with its number, just in case things got misplaced.

Now, as a Megablok set: I have really enjoyed Mega Blok's interpretation of Star Trek and TMNT characters. This set is a bit below the standards set by those previous sets. You only get 158 pieces, which isn't a terribly good value compared to other sets. Many of the pieces here are uninspiring to say the least. A bush? A weapon holder? There are, at least, three main characters to be had, Shredder, Casey Jones, and a turtle who can be switched via headband between all four characters. But the figures themselves are a bit below the standards set by other iterations. The legs don't move as well, the hands pop out of the arms for some reason, and assembling them is rather difficult for a kid, and even for a grownup, due to the difficulty of popping ball joints into sockets.

For the money, I'd prefer to see twice as many character figures and a lot less filler. My son, turning five in a few weeks, did enjoy that he could put together the simpler items on his own. But overall I think this represents a poor value compared to the other superior Mega Bloks sets in the TMNT family, such as the Krang set or the jungle tank set. And compared to other Advent calendar sets, such as the Lego Star Wars one, this is a poor value as well, as that set has 100 more pieces and 9 minifigures compared to 3 here."

Assembly by myself only took 15 minutes, very easy to build and very easy to clean! I do recommend if people have a severe allergy to wood they not get this.

I pulled this off the guest bed and put it on our king to make sure he liked it -- he loved it.  I ordered it in the king for our bed the only trouble was I had a duvet liner from IKEA in the queen that I couldn't get in a king.  I simply ordered 2 twins and sewed together as other liners I tried were heavier than we desired."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"The nylon is sturdy enough for our use.  The color was as stated and it does fit our table.  The only problem I have with it is that I was unaware that the corners had elastic.  It is like putting a fitted sheet on a pool table.  Our past ones have not had that option.  It was not stated in the description.  The reason that this is a problem for me personally is that it is really a two person job to put it on.  If you have two people to do the task, then this is a great cover for the price.  If you have to do it on your own prepare to struggle a bit."
Kindle_Store_5,0,"Why you should read it: This has been one of my favorite reads this month, and I definitely recommend it to fans of the twisted and strange. Brandon is a bad boy who uses his image to hold the world at bay, and uses his hacking skills to keep the world at arm's length. Our heroine, Emma, really sees him, which is why I think Brandon really connects with her. Now on to the plot! I think some readers will have a hard time suspending disbelief, but if you do it's a really, really intriguing concept. Without giving too much away, the mirrors are a separate ""world,"" and Brandon can hack them from his computer. His reflection, Obran, is everything he is  and isn't. My husband works with coding and computers, so when I read aloud some of the coding and hacking, he thought the idea was really cool and promptly went to look at his reflection. For tech-oriented readers and those looking for something different, I'd recommend Duplicity and am eagerly awaiting the next installment!

To see what N.K.'s idea behind Brandon's reflection was head over to the HEA blog!"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"I cannot say enough to warn you away from this pillow - please save your money.

My husband bought this pillow hoping it would be as stellar as its description and it falls short in every way. After 2 months of trying to make it work (because it was SO expensive), he gave up and returned to his old pillow. I then took up the cause (because it was SO expensive) and tried to make it work.
  - There is not a slant from either side that is comfortable for your neck
  - The material collapses with the weight of your head
  - No benefit to snoring
  - Not comfortable if you sleep on your back (my husband)
  - Not comfortable if you sleep on your side (me)
So after months of trying to literally make this work, I emailed about getting a return because MOST other expensive pillow companies have 1 or 5 year guarantees....not this place. They give you so many days to return it. My mistake to trust people because they are nurses. Why would nurses sell pillows?

Now we have this pillow no one likes, even our house guests have tried it and preferred other, older pillows to this one!"

I wanted a great, functional, and functional replacement for my old one. It's very easy to clean and holds a lot of food, so I will buy another one for my grandchildren. I was very pleased with it and am glad I did. I would not recommend this to anyone except those who want to have a nice, functional, and functional replacement for their old one. I had a broken one in my house and the old one was no longer functional. I will be purchasing another one. I really like these. They are very soft and soft.

Electronics_5,0,"This one works with my Chevy factory cassette deck and my iPod. Perfect.

Now the backstory: I had another maker's cassette adapter but the deck kept rejecting it. I purchased an&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/iriver-AFT-100-Mobile-FM-Transmitter/dp/B00067LYFW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">iriver AFT 100 Mobile FM Transmitter</a>&nbsp;and have been really underwhelmed. In frustration, I came back to the cassette adapter concept. Thanks to a previous reviewer who mentioned that this adapter works with GM factory cassette decks and others won't. I purchased this adapter and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Griffin-9749-PJBLK-PowerJolt-Auto-Charger-for-iPod-Black/dp/B000FIQC5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Griffin 9749-PJBLK PowerJolt Auto Charger for iPod (Black)</a>&nbsp;and it's a near-perfect solution for me. There's one more wire to deal with, but the sound quality (no static, no auto shutoff) is worth it.

Update 3/28/09: After about a year and a half of occasional usage, the tape deck stopped liking the adapter. It would try to change sides a couple of times and then eject the adapter. Maybe something wore out? I purchased a replacement unit and it works fine, so it wasn't the deck. Someday I'll own a car with an iPod port...

Update 12/8/09: The second one stopped working last month--that is to say, the tape deck started rejecting it. Eight months of very occasional use? I would really like to know what part is wearing down and causing this. I purchased another new one and we'll see how long that one lasts. If this one doesn't work out, maybe I'll just go buy a handful of cheap ones at the 99 Cents Only store.

Update 1/24/10: The third one stopped working, but I don't think it's the adapter; I think it's my cassette deck. So I can't really blame the adapter. I purchased an inexpensive FM transmitter (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Apple-iPod-FM-Transmitter-Car-Kit/dp/B002US9SSK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Apple iPod FM Transmitter Car Kit</a>) and it works great so far, with a lot less frustration."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,These daubers are pretty bad. I am an avid bingo player and go weekly. They sell daubers at the place I go to but they are expensive there. I was hoping by buying in bulk I would be saving money but it was a waste. First off the lid always takes the whole end of the dauber off so it's an explosion of ink waiting to happen. After you unscrew the lid you have to take the lid and push down on the ink pad to get it to click back in. Also the colors are more like paint so lavander  you can't even see the numbers behind. These things are crappy. I've ended up with a stained shirt from ink exploding and numerous ones I can't even use!

Think about it, if you carry with a round in the chamber ( you're an idiot if you dont) and you stick a gun down your pants, what is covering your trigger? Nothing. No one plans on having negligent discharges but they happen. Number 1 cause--- clothing gets in the way when drawing/ holstering the gun. What if you get in a fist fight and have to roll around on the ground? It wouldn't be hard for your shirt to get wrapped up in your trigger and go off. Do yourself a favor and possibly save your life, get a real holster. Priority 1 holsters makes an excellent product."

On Ailig's return he runs into one of his fathers Champion warrior harassing a the young widow Morainn. Her husband Hamish has been dead for 2yrs and her days of morning are over. Morainn character is ok. She is determine never to marry again and of course she fall in love with Ailig. Ailig does a good job of getting his Clan to except and trust him. In the beginning his father Neill hates the idea an does everything he can to not pass on the Cheifton to him. He seems to hate Ailig and it becomes clear why. The story held my interest. It just doesn't have much romance going on an very little sex nothing even worth mentioning. Bk. 1 and 2 just lacks that hot sexy romance story I like in the H/H. These books end abruptly for the couples. There is no epilog to let you know how the couple fared together. There are unanswered question. Such as Morainn believes she is barren. She tried to have children by her dead husband but didn't. This could have been the dead husbands fault!! But the situation is not explored.  I got the books on  Kindle Unlimited. I am not sure I would spend money buying them now that I have read the first two books in the series. To many unresolved issues in both books."

But seriously.  If you can push 60 fps at 1080p all the time and have an AMD card then you should look into getting this.  The difference between 60fps with VSync and 70-100 on FreeSync is amazing.  Things look more real.  Just do it."
Toys_and_Games_5,0,"Awesome kit, simple yet fun at the same time. Absolutely love the Twin Drive system, and how it's just as posable and articulate as the figure itself. One minor nitpick is that the GN swords don't hold up nicely when placed in the hands, they are loose and will fall out when trying to pose this figure. Other than that, it's a really awesome figure, easy to put together, and overall the product is great. If you love and are a hardcore fan of Gundam, get this and add it to your collection. Highly recommend it."
Books_5,0,"I enjoyed this book on my Kindle. I must admit the book is a lot better than the movie. The character of Edward & Bella is much better in this book than on the screen. I found the book and story line a little slow in the middle particularly the romancing of the two main characters (then again, I am a male). I feel this was omitted in the movie. I have purchased all the other books by Stehpanie and I will enjoy reading them on my Kindle. His book was easily read on my Kindle. Well done Amazon and keep up the good work.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"There is something to these Himalayan salt lamps. This is the second one I have purchased. When I purchased the first one, I wasn't expecting anything but a cute night light. We normally keep them on all day, until we go to bed. The first thing we noticed was that is seems to attract our pups. They've never tried to eat it or anything crazy. They just want to lay next to it, usually with their heads very close to it. Then I noticed my husband turned it on as soon as he got home every evening. He isn't into hokey gimmicks that may or may not have healing powers or whatever. I'm convinced that there is SOMETHING to this rock! We call them our Zen Rocks :) Maybe the amber glow is relaxing, maybe it's more. When they are not turned on, the pups don't spend much time on that side of our couch. When they aren't on, I keep thinking, I need to get off my lazy behind and turn them on, like they're calling for me ;) I LOVE OUR ZEN ROCKS!

In comparison with the other one I purchased, the color is pretty much the same. They both have a wood base and you insert the bulb into the bottom. They are both a bit oddly shaped and imperfect, which I love. This lamp doesn't have a simple on or off switch. You can turn it all the way on or only light it dimly. The reason I didn't give this lamp five stars is because it arrived in a squished box. I kept my finger crossed, but my heart sunk when I realized that the switch had a big crack in it. Luckily it works despite the crack. I wish it had been wrapped better."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"I cannot thank my boss enough for recommending Oofos sandals to me...my feet are in heaven!

My feet are wide, and flat. I call it ""Fred Flintstone Syndrome"". Trying to find shoes that a) fit correctly; and b) don't cause me to limp after a few hours is nearly impossible. I have literally spent hundreds upon hundreds of dollars in the past five years trying to find footwear that I can actually wear on a day to day basis. I have tried orthopedic inserts, Dr. Scholls inserts...you name it - I've probably tried it at least once.

Sandals were by far the most difficult to find, as most do not offer any support at all. This results in my feet taking a pounding and me being in excruciating pain within an hour or so. Unfortunately, it is hot and humid where I live from May to late September - my feet sweat easy - so I really do not want to wear closed shoes and have to deal with *that* particular issue.

These Oofos...I'm in love. I can wear these all day, and my feet are so happy. The comfort, the arch support - phenomenal. I love the black/silver color combination - it looks very classy and goes with pretty much anything I wear. Seriously, these are more comfortable than my $200 running shoes. I can't even be barefoot anymore - when I am at home, puttering around and doing chores, I have these babies on. I put them in my work tote and slip out of my dress shoes and wear these at my desk. I simply cannot get enough of them.

I will be purchasing more of these Oolala thong flip flops, in different colors. I no longer dread family outings (say, at an amusement park) because I finally have comfortable footwear to walk around in all day, without having to be the wet blanket that continually needs to sit down and ""rest her feet.""

I wish I could give these sandals more than 5 stars. They're perfect. I am a very, very satisfied customer!"

Books_5,1,"Other reviews have described the book as ""the best"" of its kind, and I'm not.

I had a lot of fun with this book, but I was not as enthralled as I was in the first book. There are some parts that I find amusing, but mostly it's just a quick read. I'm not sure if it's a good book or not, but I will say that it's pretty good.

The story itself is very well done, with the introduction of a lot of new characters. There is also a little bit of romance in this book, but it's not that bad. The main characters aren't that bad. They just seem to be sort of stuck in the past. It's a nice way to introduce new characters and introduce a lot of new ideas.

I think I'm going to give this book a four star, but I have to say that I didn't like the ending, and I really didn't like the way the author ended it. I was very disappointed with the way the book ended. I was hoping for a more more ""real"" ending, and that would have made the story more interesting.

I have to say that I'm not a big fan of the old relationship between the two main characters. I thought the relationship between them was well-developed and had some interesting twists. But, again, I don't think the author had a lot of fun in the way of the main characters.

Though I've never been overly fond of the character of Rowan Mayfair and don't see what Lestat sees in her, I'm glad Anne has brought these two together. (But oh! How I wish she'd write a continuation of The Mummy: Or Ramses The Dammed!) Obviously some people are just put off because she claims this will be her last book about Lestat. I, for one, don't believe that. I think one day she'll be walking down the street, perhaps after doing a little shopping or after a nice meal, and Lestat will pop up and tell her ""Hello, Anne. Have I got a story for you."" Because if there's one thing about Lestat we all know, he can't be shut up."

Several times in the first few pages ""criteria"" is used as a singular noun (ie, the criteria is...). Biceps is parsed to bicep, as if that makes it singular, and, most amusingly, during a scene at a Lakers' game, Kobe Bryant banks in a foul shot to win the game. I'm pretty sure Kobe has never banked in a foul shot intentionally. All in all, a lazy effort."

Movies_and_TV_5,0,"Mall Rats may not be Oscar-worthy per se, but its till worth watching if you're a Kevin Smith fan. The film stars both Ben Affleck and former skateboarder Jason Lee in their film debuts.

The plot: T.S. Quint (played by Jeremy London) and Brodie Bruce (played by the aforementioned Jason Lee) are two best friends, who spend too much time at their local mall, and are then dumped by their girlfriends Brandi Svenning (played by Claire Forlani) and Rene Mosier (played by Shannon Doherty) for being unemployed, immature and overall slackers. TS wants to get married to Brandi, even though he's still in college. But what stands in not only his way, but Brodie's way as well, is Brandi's father, Jared (played by Michael Rooker, of AMC's Walking Dead fame), who is hosting a game show, Truth or Date, at the duo's favorite mall. The two then ""hire"" the famed Clerks duo, Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (film's director, Kevin Smith) to not only help them get their girlfriends back, but to trash the set of said show and get it kicked off the airwaves before it premieres. In an interesting subplot, Willam Black (played by Ethan Suplee in his film debut) has been spending his spare time from opening 'til closing staring at a Magic Eye poster, which is said to be a sailboat, however, he can't see it!

The DVD: This DVD is awesome, it is double sided. It has the original theatrical version on Side A, and on Side B, an extended, unrated version of the film which runs approximately 2 hrs., 1 min. (121 min.) as opposed to the original theatrical version which runs 1 hr. 35 min. (95 min.) Aside from that, the extras are fantastic!

A must buy if you're a Kevin Smith fan!!"

It would fit a mini couch, or a overstuffed chair but not a standard loveseat. The microfiber cloth is very thin too. One of the selling points which attracted me to the cover was its elastic back supportive strap, well the strap was so short I couldn't stretch the strap over the couch's back so I just cut if off.

This delightful romance is filled with twists and turns and the occasional fall and you have to find out what happens next.  This story tells of the long road back to living by a widower writer and a librarian who has her own shadows.  The fact that they are each responsible for the life of a child plays well into the story.  This is a terrific read that will leave you with a smile.

Books_5,0,"While I still enjoyed aspects of this series, I found this book unnecessarily complex in its mythological meanderings. I am not exactly sure was Atticus did with Granuaile for 12 years, but that might have been more interesting than this book. Things progress on the Granuaile arena, at least.

I think the conversations with Oberon seemed to get a bit too much (too cute by half) and got in the way of the story. As other reviewers have noted, I have been bothered by the brevity of these books and it sure does seem that Hearnes is using mythological twaddle as filler for his recent books. I enjoyed the first few much more, perhaps because they were anchored more in the real world. In the last couple of books there is a magical deus ex machina to solve all the problems of the complicated mess Atticus seems to have made for himself. Not sure if I will continue to buy into this series."

Movies_and_TV_5,0,"My only recollection of the TV version of ""The Green Hornet"" is when they did a guest appearance on ""Batman"".  Robin(Burt Ward) fought Kato(Bruce Lee) to a draw(?!).  Kipnapped heiress Pinky Pinkston left an SOS for the Dynamic Duo in her alphabet soup.  The guest villain was the incomparable Roger C. Carmel as Colonel Gumm.  What does all this have to do with the price of tea in China?  Absolutely nothing but I figured I'd write some totally superfluous and extraneous remarks for the Hornet haters who'll get all over me for loving this movie.  I never read the comic books or saw the Tv series so I accept this movie for what it is and it's a total blast.  Star/writer/producer Seth Rogen took a character that is sacrosanct to many and fashioned it to fit his devil-may-care persona purists be damned.  The nocturnal adventures of the Hornet and Kato come off more as a fraternity pledge prank than as some altruistic endeavor and I thought that was a hoot.  What would Kevin Smith think?  Rogen is aces in my book but the real find is Jay Chou as Kato. Chou's Kato has a real alliance with the Hornet instead of just riding shotgun and displaying his karate moves.  Christoph Waltz extends his street cred that he established in ""Inglourious Basterds"" as the head of the Russian mob and he's as equally chilling and funny as he was in that movie.  James Franco has a terrific cameo as Waltz's ""competition"".  And how can you forget the cool cars and stunt work.  I love that Rogen took the material not too seriously but just serious enough."

It's almost worthwhile to consult someone who has an iPad or someone who can guide you to what would work best in you personal daily use. This is in most cases not going to replace a laptop, or a desktop computer. The size of the screen is really nice, but then you can't put it in a suit jacket pocket. Nice to have with you, Yes. Easy to leave laying somewhere, Yes.

Make sure what you want to primarily want to do, really exists, this i not Mac OS X, this is iOS 4.3. If staying online is that important AND you don't mind carrying it around (it's not heavy, but it's bulky), then you could consider this gadget. It's like a sports car, it's nice to have, but it's not a necessity. What would be nice is something between the iPad 2 and the iPhone / iPad Touch sized iPad mini, that would be half the screen size of the iPad 2. This way, it might not fit in all suit jacket pockets, but could be carried in a shoulder holster or similar carrier under the jacket, sweater or what have you.

Be aware that there is no volume control on the earbuds themselves. For most uses they are amazing value for money. For the use I bought them for (in the line-out jack from a TOM TOM GPS on a motorcycle) they weren't the best choice. But I removed the soft silicon ends, drilled a hole in the end of the foam earplugs I always wear on the bike, and zip tied the earplugs on to replace the original ends. This is now exactly what I needed - the ear plug attenuates the (very LOUD) volume from the line-out jack, and also provide the sound isolation I needed.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the front of the unit is a plastic ""good"" case, but it's a little difficult to open and close. I wish it had a little more padding for the corners. The only thing I wish I had known was that I could use this in a different room or on different floors. But that's not what I expected.

I wanted something loose-ish to sleep in, bought lgt gray, not usually forgiving color. I thought these not only fit perfect but also look cute enough to wear out. They are about mid-rise, with wide waistband. You could pull it down for a lower rise pant. I haven't actually worn them, I know people say drawstring is decorative only.  I could have even gone small, so for skinny people these could be too loose. I was pleasantly  surprised w pant and It's a forgiving style. Of course this is just my opinion everyone has different shapes. Hope this helps
  REVISION;  Ok have to revise my feedback. I washed these pants, shrank 1full size, no longer forgiving color , no longer cute. They didn't soften up in wash, they were stiff, but I thought they pressed them. They are 90%cotton. These pants are now just OK , I'll wear 4 sleeping only but nt even soft.

Pet_Supplies_5,0,"If you replace the pump with a Whisper 10 air pump or something more powerful than the pump that comes with the Whisper 3i filter, then you have a serviceable little, low profile filter. Puts out about 25 gallon per hour then. I coupled it with an Azoo Mignon 60 HOB compact power filter. I had several others where I also switched out the pump. (Use for airstone or sponge filter.).  Because I have a lip on one the tanks, I had to modify the attachment system.  I cut and shaped a length of plastic coated wire hanger into 2 S hooks. I coated the exposed metal ends with aquarium sealer. Then I drilled 2 holes, spaced 2 inches apart in the upper back of the filter housing.  Place the S hooks through the holes and hang of over the lip of your tank.  Be sure and measure for correct desired water level. Final touch. Put a suction cup on the lower stud of the filter back. Be sure to clean the area of the tank wall where the suction cup is to be placed. Stiff, coated auto or household electrical wire will also work for making the attachment hooks. Now the formerly deficient filters work great. They use a minute amount of space and now have more suction and outflow. Be sure to occasionally clean the hole where the airline meets the uptake tube. I enlarged mine. I also had one where a hole had not been drilled through. All the other Tetra Power filters, 10i and above are strong, long lasting, quality filters."

I love the color and the fact that the hose is a little longer than I expected. This one has a nice white finish. I like that the hose is longer than the one I had. The hose has a small, rubber ring that helps keep it clean. I am really happy with this purchase. UPDATE:  I received a replacement for the broken one on December 12, 2017.

The smaller candles smell wonderful using this candle warmer though, without any combustion or smoke, so that's great. Buyer beware though, this is made of plastic which means it is very unsafe to use more than a couple of hours or the plastic may begin to melt. Most companies have moved over to ceramic candle warmers to avoid this issue, but if you just want something cheap and you are not a forgetful person then this candle warmer is stellar and sits at a great price."

Kindle_Store_5,0,"Michael G. Thomas is a well known author when it comes to science fiction novels and it definitely shows. He did really well with the third installment of the Star Crusades: Mercenaries series, ""War of the Exiles"".

I was introduced to the series from a friend of mine that knows I am not a big sci-fi fan but after I read the first book - I just kept going. The book is a great example of a military sci-fi that puts you on a action packed journey full of surprises. The character development is top notch and the book is very well written. I personally fell in love with the character ""Spartan"" the most. The book has a ton of stuff going on including some terrorism which I believe is a way of connecting the reader to a more present state of whats currently going on around us in today's society. When you get into these books you will start noticing the author has a full on fictional universe going on inside his head not just a single story. I would compare it to something along the lines of Game of Thrones but in space with the depth in each series.

Highly recommend the book to anyone who loves sci-fi / military books or just anyone looking for a great read in general."

I got word yesterday that several of the Lego pieces were split & broken in the individual sealed bags! And since they were critical pieces that had to do with the castle structure the toy can't even be used. My nephew was heartbroken since this was his ""big"" gift. One would think for $80.00+ you'd get a little more for your buck. I would NOT recommend this toy to anyone unless the manufacturer gets their quality control shortcomings straightened out.

Kindle_Store_5,0,"This is the second book in Barbour's holiday series. Well-written plot with realistic characters that has no real connection to the Christmas holiday other than the setting. Deputy Shawna Mallory is a thirty-one year old single cop who lives in the rather sleepy town of Carlton Grove. She has a deep commitment to her job, and moves quickly when she hears an amber alert on the radio for a missing eleven year old boy. Mallory hears a dog barking; she finds the boy under a snow drift being guarded by the pup. The sheriff agrees to take the boy in while he awaits a new foster care family.

Complications arise when the boy's real father arrives back on the scene from an overseas assignment in Chile. John Reid McCrae appears to have a poor parenting track record, but Shawna's friend Alice knew him many years ago and offers a different opinion. In the meantime Shawna grows attached to Billy, who is about to be given to a new foster family. Billy runs away once again, but even more puzzling is the strange affect Billy's dad has upon Shawna. What outcome ensues for Billy, John, and the Deputy Sheriff whose lives have become entangled.

A heartwarming story revolving around coming of age, domestic violence, foster care, romance, pets and peer relationships that will tear at the heart strings of young adult and adult readers. Actually, the book could be a middle grade read if one is willing to look past a few curse words and one or two light romantic scenes. Snow Pup is the kind of story that will put the reader in the mood for the holiday season."

It feels sturdy enough, but we don't move it much, and we've made a point of leaning the lid against the wall after reading about problems with the hinges. My only complaint is that there isn't a good way to install a liner bag. The hinges prevent you from just hanging it over the edge. I used a couple of command hooks to hold my bag up, but it's not an ideal solution."

Pet_Supplies_5,1,"I did purchase elsewhere due to the large size and it was a little difficult to get the pet to take it off the leash. The leash is very light and easy to take off and on. The material is very durable and I would recommend it for dogs with heavy hands.Great for the price.  I have a German Shepherd and a medium-size dog.  I like the size for my dogs, but I like the fact that they don't have a leash on their body.  I also like that the harness is adjustable, so they can't pull or jump out of the harness.  I like that the material is soft, not too soft.  It is also made of tough plastic and the dog doesn't seem to mind wearing it.  It's also a good quality dog collar.  I have a very tough chew toy and this is my second one.  It was very well made and was easy to put together.  I would recommend this for a dog who has a lot of loose hair or loose skin.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has a large dog.

One thing that I would like to note is that the description for this collar is very misleading.  There are a few things I can tell you about the collar, but I will be giving it a 5.  The description says that it is ""Upper-collar, upper-collar, lower-collar, dog"

Toys_and_Games_5,0,"For an action figure like this, where the ""main attraction"" revolves around the use of the blaster in his hand, I feel it does not meet the build quality in comparison to the rest of the toy.

The toy itself is detailed, and is sturdy enough for a 3 year old to have many hours of fun with. The blaster? Not so much. It stopped serving it's purpose within about 2 weeks.

Overall, the toy is not a bad purchase by any means, and pretty much becomes an essential action figure once your child sees Toy Story 2 for the first time, but if you do purchase, just be aware that the blaster is flimsy."

Kindle_Store_5,0,"The Sweetest Taboo by author Harper Miller, is a stunning debut BDSM novel depicting a BWWM D/s interracial romance. Rick and micah's relationship is neither unrealistic to the lifestyle, nor is it unrealistic to a fairytale or whirlwind romance you might hear about over brunch with your friends  and author Harper Miller's deft turn with the pin (mesmeric, though?) is certainly a refreshing addition to the IR/MC genre. Specifically, I really appreciate the intense amount of effort that went into both the packaging as well as the research  the cover is stunning (I want to be micah, and I want to be with Rick) and the very skillful editing. No spoilers here, but I hope that this author has an extremely bright future, and I look forward to reading many, many more of her books. Great craft!

definitely worth the $20 or so i paid for it. it installed like a breeze (note that it'll fit into a slot that a normal sized CD/DVD drive would fit into).  It can control up to 5 fans and it'll vary speed and in the case of my fans brightness of the LEDs.
When the fans (5 of them) are full blast, it can get pretty loud. i usually don't turn them up to full blast unless doing something strenuous to my computer like playing games doing some data analysis of huge data sets.
overall good and worth the investment for a more customized computer. probably not very useful if you have 1 fan."

The couple comes to within a hair's breadth of falling apart but it is Sam who first recognises problems and temptations when he resists an attractive work colleague Sara played by Natasha Mc Elhone.  He then confronts his partner who steps back from the edge of a moral abyss.  Sense is ultimately seen by all and the two lifestyles choose to recognise and respect their differences.
The plot is virtually non-existent.  Rather, the film is a study of the simmering tensions between two very different ways of life.  It is this tension that sustains the film."

Pet_Supplies_5,0,"My ferret loves this Vitamin Supplement! I love this product and have purchased it for almost 5 years and will continue to purchase it for the well-being of my girl.  I give it to her every day by breaking up the amount into two servings so, that she can enjoy it in the morning, and in the evening.

This supplement has kept her very healthy, her coat is very shiny, and her appetite is very good.  My ferret is very small and this has kept her weight on because it provides her with a healthy appetite.  My vet recommended this item to me during my first visit because she is so small, and keeping weight on her is very important.

What I love most about this item is how crazy my girl gets when she sees the tube, she does a cute little dance, and fluffs up her coat.  She could be in the other room and I will tap the tube in my hand and she will come running.  This is a great company that makes great products and has kept my ferret healthy. This Vitamin Supplement has a good list of vitamins for their overall health.  Most of all the taste seems to be very appealing to my girl.

I would recommend this item to any ferret owner as a supplement and also if you are having problems getting your ferret to eat or maintain weight, give her or him some of this prior to their meal and their appetite should be good to go in about 10 minutes or so.  Sometimes their appetite could be affected by hairballs so I would also recommend adding a hairball aid to their weekly health regime and after baths too."
Books_5,0,"This historical thriller revolves around the Earl of Walden and his family, who all become involved in a life and death struggle the outcome of which could have a serious influence on World War 1.

Walden receives a visit from Churchill, asking for help negotiating with Russia about alliances in the forthcoming War.  Walden feels this is an exciting opportunity to further his career, whilst his Russian wife finds it brings back unwanted memories of a love she has tried to put behind her.  Meanwhile their daughter is busy thinking about being presented to the King and Queen and her first Season  whilst beginning to discover that the real world is not quite as her sheltered upbringing has led her to believe.

Alongside the family activities in London and at their country estate,  the suffragettes are fighting for womens rights, a Russia anarchist has arrived to assassinate the Russian delegate Walden is negotiating with, and interesting discussions are being held on the moving of European boundaries to satisfy political needs.

I found this book disappointing.  The writing style, as usual with Ken Follett, is excellent, and the story moves along at a steady pace.  However I never found myself particularly interested in the main characters.  Many of the historical detail from that time are fascinating ; the social norms of aristocratic women, the suffragettes and the political upheavals going on.  So, its a nice easy read, with interesting background information."

Movies_and_TV_5,1,"This movie wasn't really that good. The plot was just too predictable. There were too many horrible scenes. There was a scene where a girl and her dog fight, and it was pretty bad. The scene where the dog falls in love with a girl is really bad. There was no real love story. And then there was the scene where the girl's dog goes out to dinner with a girl. There was no romance or even a sex scene. There was a scene where a guy throws a man in the face. The scene where a guy breaks into the house, and then he's shot by the police is really bad. The scene where a guy's girlfriend is killed is really bad. I really liked this movie, but I don't like the way the story was told. There was a scene where a man gets shot by a police officer and then he falls in love with another guy, and then"

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"I had been looking for a jean shirt to replace my old one.  This shirt is soft and fits my SHORT figure to a 'T'.  Usually I purchase a large, but decided to order an XL since the fabric is 100 percent cotton.  Happy I did. Washes well.  Did not put in dryer."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,1,"The original thing that caught my eye was the chain. I saw it on a website and ordered the same pair.  The chain itself is very small, and the inside of the chain is stretched out.  It's a little thin, but it's not too big.  The chain itself is very pretty, and the color is a very pretty blue.  I've had the chain for a few months now, and I think it's going to last a long time.  The material is very light, and the color is very vibrant.  I haven't had it in a while, but I'm sure I'll be getting it in the next couple of weeks.  The reason I bought this pair was because the sizing is off.  I didn't like the color at all, and it's not the best looking chain I've ever had.  I'm still wearing it, but I don't really like it.  It's pretty cute, but I'm not sure how it'll hold up.

I'm 5'4"", 130lbs, and I ordered a large.  It fit perfectly, and I ordered a large in a large.  I don't think it will hold up to washing, but it's definitely a little snug.  I bought a small and it fit fine.  It is a bit small for my liking, but it still works well for"

Toys_and_Games_5,0,"My five year old really enjoyed this toy, but would still rather put makeup on herself.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it wasn't packaged it a way that was convenient to store the makeup between uses. Given the potential mess factor with this toy I wish there was a way to easily put the makeup away included, but I simply used a ziplock bag to store. Overall though it was a cute and unique toy for the price - great value."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"Beautiful earrings! These were delivered to me by my mailman during the middle of my annual memorial day party. Everyone kept asking what did you get??? What was in the box from Amazon. I planned to open it later, but my nosy family insisted on seeing what I had. So, I finally opened my package. I had 3 items in there from Amazon, one of which was a pretty little black box. I opened it knowing it would be these earrings. As soon as I took them out of the box everyone oooed and ahhhhhh'd. Then they all said they look really expensive. My mother had recently celebrated her 75th birthday, which is in May. She grabbed them out of my hands and said she loved them and that this was her birthstone, so she would like to have them. She told me she would give me a check for them once she got home. My mother is a simple lady and not materialistic at all, so the fact that she was so taken by these speaks volumes for the quality. She then put them in her ears and proudly wore them home. I told her that since she loved them so much I wanted her to keep them as another gift for her special birthday.
These are gorgeous, well made and they did come with the different backings. One is called a butterfly backing, and not sure what the other is called. Anyway, I guess I will be ordered another set and will not be opening in front of anyone, lol.
I and the rest of my family would recommend them. They are small, but impressive. It is true what they say that good things come in small packages.
I did receive these at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,What can I say.  Its a flashlight.  I bought this particular one because almost all my cordless tools are DeWalt 18 V  Maybe the next generation will have LED bulbs instead.
Electronics_5,0,"This is one of the best Mac laptops on the market, period.  (The best PC laptop on the market, in my opinion is the Sony VAIO Z series with the high res screen option).

I recently traded the 15"" for this 13"" and although I greatly miss the 15"" screen and the wonderful speakers on the 15"" (the 13"" speakers are good but not as rich and bassy as the 15"") but overall I love this smaller machine.

Let me get what I don't like out of the way:

--wish the screen resolution were much higher (compare to the Sony VAIO Z series which has such outrageous screen resolution)
--wish it were a bit lighter that 4.5 lbs (although this machine is exceptionally sturdy, so willing to deal with a little bit heavier than similar size machines)

And that's it for the wish list.  Now what I absolutely love:

--the ergonomics -- way better than anything else out there, PC or Mac.
--backlit keyboard, comfortable typing area (feels luxurious to rest your hands on the surface of the textured aluminum area)
--fast OS (Snow Leopard), fast machine, great power management
--first machine i've owned that doesn't get overly hot, in fact even barely warm

What I do highly recommend though is to get -- if you can afford it -- is a 256Gb SSD (Corsair).  This gives the machine extra speed, better battery power, and true longevity.  No need to worry about damaging the disk while traveling, defragmenting (oh, so glad that era is over).  This is an expensive option ($650 or so) but really well worth it by a long shot.  The SSD equipped machine will last you a long time."
Movies_and_TV_5,0,"I loved this DVD!!! But, it made me really sad because the series is gone!! After it was over, I wanted to see more!!It was great to see the unusual suspects, but I have to confess I missed Colonol O'Neill, I wish they could have at least had him do a cameo appearance. It was nice to wrap up the Ori story line, we were all left hanging abit with the last televised episode.  But, they left a little mystery behind, because we still had to wonder if they were really finished!!! This is a DVD that all fans of the series must own!!"

It already has a charcoal filter on top, but I noticed an odor towards the end of the day when my kitty's droppings have been sitting there a while.

I added one magic pad instead of 2 since it was to supplement the big filter it already had, and it's good for about a month. My kitty is happy, and so am I."

My daughter has already been playing with this for about 2 months now and is still very happy with it. I am very pleased with this purchase. My son is almost 3, and he enjoys playing with this toy. He is super happy with the toys he received, especially the ""sticky"" one. I was very disappointed that this toy was a bit small for him. It was a gift for a nephew. He also received some of the other toys for his gift. I wish he had gotten the other ones. I was very happy with this purchase. Great game for the kids."
Electronics_5,0,A lot of nice pieces that come in handy when you're getting the best shot.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,Love this light. My neighbor was so impressed that he is buying some also. We like the spread of the flood light. We have many oak trees and the light disperses from the ground to well into the top of the tree and just as Impressive width wise. If you are looking for a spot beam this is not for you. But if you want to cove a wide area I do recommend this unit. I also like the output of the daylight version better than the warm white version.

I had to replace a GFCI that was not working.  This GFCI had no issues with the g-wire.  This GFCI did not have the problem.  I have a similar GFCI that is not working with the same g-wire.  I had to replace it with another model.  I have a good experience with these g-wire replacements.

I would recommend this GFCI for anyone who needs a GFCI with a different installation.  This g-wire is the only option available to me for the GFCI.  I would recommend to anyone who needs to replace a GFCI with a different installation.  This GFCI is made of metal and will not rust.

Toys_and_Games_5,0,Purchased this for my grandson.  He loves it.  Great variety of pieces and the buildings and vehicles that come with the table provide opportunity for imagination.  The one problem that we encountered is that the engine of the train provided is too tall to go under the bridge of the set.  This proves to be very frustrating to my grandson who really has problems with things of this nature.  He likes to be in control of the environment and wants things to work as they are designed to work.  I also paid extra to Amazon to have it gift wrapped and the paper was torn and box dinged up upon delivery.  I had to re-wrap the gift to make it presentable.  It could have been packaged better by Amazon.  Bubble wrap around gift wrap to keep packaging secure.  Other than that it seems to be a great purchase that will provide my grandson with hours of fun and entertainment.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"These were a little smaller than I had intended, but that's because I didn't pay attention to the size in ounces and then go compare them to one of my older glasses that are similar. But, you know what? That's GOOD, because I'm less likely to overdrink various poured liquids that are high in calories. I like THAT. And, they're less fragile as a result. I'm impressed by the fact that these are more durable in their base than the larger ones I used to break too often, being glass. So, it all works out. They're also easily cleaned by hand; whereas, the larger ones I had were deep and harder to get into the corners of inside the base."

He still gets some dry, brown ""eye boogers"" in the corners of his eyes (the color, BTW, which some reviewers describe as looking like ""blood,"" is likely normal and due to oxidization), which we find easy to remove, and there are almost no more tears.  So we are satisfied with this product."

Toys_and_Games_5,0,"The Princess guitar is a pretty in pink starter guitar for small hands and short arms; however, there are some reservations that other reviewers also mentioned.

My 7 and 9 year old girls want to learn guitar.  A full sized guitar is hard for them to manage.  This is more their size.  It does need constant tuning- probably the biggest drawback.  My girls are learning off ""Alfred's Complete Kids' Guitar Course"".  It starts with single finger chords: C-G7-G then a 3 finger chord D7, which are fine on this guitar since it only involves the high 3-4 stings(mostly G-B-E).

For full 6 string strumming, there's usually a string that needs to be tuned or one can just ignore it, and let them strum and play to their imagination.  Our strings have not broken yet.  They have covers for the nuts and stickers to id the open string(which eventually fall off- not a biggie).  It's opening is small and the resonance very limited.

I find our girls use this for play, pretend and simple practice.  For better sound, they mess around with our electric quitar on a mini-amp.  For their age group, it takes time to get use to pressing the strings down and toughen and strenthen their little fingers up.  It's all for fun and they're advancing quite well at their own pace.

Overall, consider the cost and what you want out of a guitar- if it is just fun and goofing around with a little intro to the instrument- this one might suit you; otherwise, buy a better one."

The only complaint I have is that it's very hard to turn it off when you're driving, and if you pull it on, it won't turn on. It's very easy to turn it on, and it works well.

Kindle_Store_5,0,"I was excited to see a new Christian DD book because you don't see very many in the DD world. This book was okay the characters were young and still in high school so at times they came off as very immature. The town they lived in and the school they went to seemed a bit unrealistic, the fact that Ashley's father could go from never spanking her to as harsh as was felt unbelievable. Ashley's character really frustrated me the constant back and forth on her feelings for Jackson, and Jackson was really pushy about getting married. Throughout the book we get to watch them go through marriage classes and that's when it starts to feel like a ""how to"" book. There are only a few spanking scenes in this book and only one between Ashley and Jackson.

Kindle_Store_5,0,"Summer is a good time to sit back, chill out, and pick up a romance novel or two.  Its not taxing.  The light reading stirs up memories of our own youthful days and is a welcome holiday for the brain.  Unlikely Love was a good choice.

Three sisters return to their childhood home to attend their father's funeral.  Estranged from each other and their father for many years, they are pleasantly surprised at the transformation of the Bed and Breakfast from ramshackle to opulent resort.  They are to inherit this new found wealth ... or are they?  There are conditions, complications, and a good dollop of romance laced with suspense, to say any more would be a giveaway.  It's a page turner good for a quick read under the shade of a tree."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"After doing much research at various trusted sources, I selected this product.  The only thing I don't like about it is the flexible ""straws"" it comes with STINK bad.....like the worst plastic chemical smell I've been around (most have been China made).  I'm trying to soak the bottle (without the filter) in hot soapy water along with doing the same with the flexible pieces in a small bowl.  Based on research it sounds like this eventually goes away (thank God).

Bottom line for me:  I believe in this product and plan on buying more of these and/or other ones from Sawyer but wish they could do something about the smell; if they did, it'd be 5-star rating no problem whatsoever."

This has given him a great amount of energy.  It's very healthy for him and his digestive system.  I would recommend this food to anyone who has a dog with a chronic digestive issue.  Highly recommend this food.

I've used this product for about a year now and it's been well worth the money.  It's not a perfect product for a dog with a chronic digestive issue, but it does what it's supposed to do.  It's not the most nutritious food out there, but I think I've found it works for my dog as well.My dogs love this food.  They have been eating it for several months now and it seems to be doing great.  I'm very happy with the quality of this food.  It's made in the USA.

It is the basic concept of UNO (even has Skip and Wild) while keeping it simple for the little ones.  You get farm animals instead of cards.  They are different colors and different animals to help kids learn to match.  Game play doesn't take very long and the kids absolutely love it.  The only downfall is that they love the little animals so much that if we don't put this out of reach, it will be missing animals in no time!"

It was comfortable and great for running or walking with your pet, however, the clasp stopped holding after about 60 uses, which was only about  2 months.  I will buying it again in the future.

Movies_and_TV_5,0,"Jeanette MacDonald shines like a bright Northern star in this 1933 MGM classic also starring Ramon Novarro. Novarro was a matinee idol at MGM during the silent era; in 1922, after filming ""The Prisoner of Zenda,"" MGM executives brought him into their studio as the Latin lover after the sudden and unexpected demise of Rudolph Valentino. Novarro had only two years in his contact with MGM when he did ""The Cat and the Fiddle."" Novarro offers a brilliant performance as Victor Florescu, a talented, Brussels-based composer of serious music under the tutelage of respected Professor Bertier. When he meets beautiful Shirley Sheridan (MacDonald), a New Yorker living in Brussels as a professional Opera singer, the two bohemians fall in love. The story is a musical comedy and the songs from the Kern-Harbaugh stage musical comedy is used largely intact. Jeanette MacDonald's ""The Night Was Made for Love"" later became a big hit. This pre-code film is not without controversy with regards to the moral codes, since MacDonald and Navarro are portrayed as live-in companions.

Many movie critics and fans were used to Novarro in silent movies and they were less enthusiastic about his talkie movies. In fact some of the greatest silent stars of MGM had difficulty making success when talkies came along. I for one enjoyed this romantic comedy tremendously. I thought MacDonald and Novarro made lovely couple and the story is full of warmth."

Books_5,0,"Beginning was choppy.  The first-person perspective choice got in the way of character introductions.  Novel doesn't get going until page 50ish.  Disappointed at how the mutiny plot thread was resolved.

Middle was creepy, suspenseful, and had some horrific images.  It also had sermons and discussions about religion that I skipped.  Was more interested in the actual mystery than the author's repeated return to philosophy where he kept asking 'what is the unknown' through various guises.

Ending was scattershot, and it did not resolve anything in terms of character inter-relationships.  Author wrote a super-slow beginning where he painstakingly laid down a hierarchy of relationships, and the ending made no effort to build on or resolve any of that.

I wasn't into this one much.  Russo did have a big success in that the unknown aliens were actually unknown, alien, scary and incomprehensible.  The book over-focuses on the human characters who were little more than talking heads with personal neuroses.  Three stars, parts I liked, parts I didn't."

Kindle_Store_5,0,"Quiet,strong,handsome,shy when it comes to women, has trouble making decisions and the inability to  say ""NO"" to anyone describe this Hot, Hunky, Cowboy version of a tarnished saint. James Taylor sold his ranch in Texas, ended a 3 year relationship to a women he did not love and came home to raise his horses.  Mindy MacAllister has made mistakes and paid the price.  She wants to find someone who will love her despite of her past and raise a family.  When the Taylor brothers Aunt Cappy talks her into coming home, she jumps at the chance hoping to see the one Taylor brother that has held her heart since she was a child.  Nothing worth wild is easy in life and the budding relationship between the two characters is a prime example of this.  Aunt Cappy's meddling, the other tarnished saints not so helpful help and the past that does not want to stay in the past make for an entertaining reading experience. James has a big heart and a lot of love to give and is the first tarnished saint that I have read about who has an almost perfect halo.  If he could just learn to say no and make decisions he could probably ascend and become the first Taylor saint."

I'm sure other more expensive knives are better but for someone that isn't hardcore, this is a perfect knife (thus far), It's sharp, opens smoothly, feels solid, and not expensive.

Girl Love Happens is definitely more erotica than her previous books, but I enjoyed seeing Gemma and Tegan jump into first love with all the excitement, suspense, and wild emotions that go along with it. I always enjoy the characters that Ms. Markinson creates, and the fact that they are not simple characters. Even though we've only gotten to meet these two and their social circle, I feel as though I've gotten a good picture of each person. I also love that this is a serial story, and that we get it in bits and pieces rather than all at once. I cannot wait to see what happens next!"

I also feel this series followed the books closely and tried to put in as many aspects as possible.  My boyfriend and I went to see ""Breaking Dawn Part 2"" together in theaters.  He is not as into the saga as I am, he just goes with because I make him.  He enjoyed the crowd more than the movie.  He laughed at the crowd's reaction to Alice's vision. He said you could hear everyone sigh with relief.  I think this movie was great.  It always kept you on your toes, never knowing what to expect next.  After seeing this video in theaters I was extremely confused.  I loved how the movie took you off course, but I had a hard time keeping track of who was killed.  I was almost in tears seeing everyone get killed.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  This is one where I could watch it over and over and never get sick of it.  ""Breaking Dawn Part 2"" was the perfect ending to the story.  Knowing that Bella and Edward can finally live in happiness and peace together is elating.  I would highly recommend the entire series.  It might be about vampires and werewolves, but you have to look past that and catch the love story."

I had it figured it who was the stalker to both Victoria and to Jack, with a little twist I didn't see coming.  The characters were believable and you could easily see where future books are headed.

Victoria is a fiesty woman who knows what she wants and goes after it.  Duke and Jack are perfect for Victoria and they make a great threesome.  I loved the scene in the bar where all 7 women were getting toasted and giving to tips on what to do with Duke once they got home.  Fortunately Duke was there to be there designated driver.

I would recommend it.This is a great camera for the price.  I was looking for a little flash to give my pictures with and this is the perfect solution.  It was very easy to install and works great.  It is very convenient to carry around as well.  The battery life is also great.  The shutter release is nice, it is easy to use and easy to operate.  The sound quality is great.  The flash is very clear and easy to use.  The only thing I would change about it is that it takes a little getting used to, but it is very easy to use and well made.  I would recommend it.I bought this for my son for"

Electronics_5,0,"Purchased four of these camera's the info that comes with them sucks . This is the fifth one that I received the picture was blurry right out of the box. Never had a camera that was blurry right out of the box. I finally hooked it up a video camera, put it on my lap and played with the focus and zoom knobs. Nothing I did would bring it into focus. So I returned this one. I forgot which knob adjusts what, there are no directions to tell you. I didn't matter I played with it more a half hour and nothing worked, so back it goes. I got four good ones, so I reordered it. The four that I am using have been working for about a year and a half They are very clear and have very good night vision. The only problem you could have with these cameras is, that the night vision is so strong, that it might be too bright in close in setting..
Update; Got another one of these, they shipped it really fast. Perfectly focused in the widest position. Mounted it adjusted a little bit. Happy camper  now. What makes a camera like this so good, is, that you can put them anywhere and make them work. It is very difficult to find a fixed lens 2.8 MM camera. So this does it all. A note. I've had one of these mounted out from under the eave where it is exposed  to sun and the rain, no problems. It has been there for about a year and a half. The main weakness of this camera is, the IR coverage. I throws out an intense spotlight leaving the edges in darkness. I would say the coverage is about 2/3 of the area. I used this camera to replace a inexpensive fixed lens camera that fogs up after rain. But that camera covered the entire area in an even light."
Electronics_5,0,Great product! Put into my first build. I'm pleased with the results.

Pet_Supplies_5,0,"Prettier than the typical metal crates, which we were wanting since our dog sleeps indoors. However, I thought I'd be nice and let him have it outside one cooler day and he jumped on it and broke one of the bars. It still stands upright since there are other frame pieces holding it together. I like that we can lock the zipper quickly and easily."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,I did run but due to back issues needed something with less impact. This has fit the bill just fine!
Movies_and_TV_5,0,"This is perhaps my least favorite collection of Sansone workouts. Along with a handful of old LS tapes, I have Leslie's '5-Day Fit Walk'....which I really like....and 'Ultimate Collection' (yet to do all the routines).

'Muscle Mile One' is your basic one mile. '30 Minute Walk' (also on '5-Day Fit Walk') is good. When I need a fairly gentle workout and want a cast of very real people (not Leslie's fellow instructors or a group of the familiar faces) 'Walk Diet One Mile' suffices (no production value here). 'Walk Strong Express' is my fave on this DVD. Challenging and makes for a nice change with the interval training (and the participants using different kinds of weights).

In search of variety and options beyond the basic four LS moves I was interested in 'You Can Do Pilates.' I'm not familiar with her solo offering by the same name, which has a slightly longer run time, so it may afford more in the way of instruction. Were it not for the fact I have some knowledge of Pilates this would be way too confusing. It lacks detailed breathing and body positioning cues, and, in my opinion, presumes the participant has an intermediate skill level.(As a Boomer, my Pilates faves are Carol Argo's 'Anti-Aging Method' and Maggie Rhoades' 'Pilates Complete for Inflexible People.')

As with some of the other 'collections' the music of these older workouts....upon which I rely to keep me moving and in sync with the workout...is weak much of the time. The sound quality from one workout to another lacks consistency, as well. Given my other LS workout options, this one is rarely in the rotation."
Toys_and_Games_5,1,Bought these for our Disney Princesses and they love them!  We also have the Clue.
Toys_and_Games_5,1,"I could talk for at least an hour with my son about it. He loves the music and the other items.  The plastic parts are also very easy to clean.  I would definitely recommend this toy to any kid.  Highly recommend.This is a great gift. The kids love it. It is a good size for them to carry around and it is a great size for a toddler. It does not have a lot of storage on it. It is well made and will last for years to come. You can change it up and out of the box, but it is a great addition to any party.I bought this for my 4 year old son who loves Lego and loves building things. He's got a lot of fun with this, and he likes to play with it constantly. He also loves putting the pieces together, and I'm happy to say that he's not quite finished yet.

Electronics_5,0,"I own a longer length of this.  when I cut it open and examined it, I found a nice foil wrap (good) but shockingly very little copper braid, which IS the return path to current flow and also provides a place to ground TO.  all the foil in the world won't help when the copper is so thin and weak.  same for inner conductor, the wire quality is poor and the strands are few.  the dialectric is not flexible and is too stiff.

this is low quality cable.  if you buy a sample and cut it, you'll see."
Electronics_5,1,"Before purchasing, I checked my web interface and found the instructions included in the instructions for the screen protector. I had to replace the screen protector with the TRS-38, which is a bit of a pain in the butt, as it's not very bright."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"Love these hangers! I've been trying to find kids size/baby size velvet hangers for a while now. Target (the store that has everything) didn't have them online nor in store. When I did find them in store, the value was overpriced for a pack of 5 or 10, but 30 of these hangers for $12 is such a good value! I rated this review 4 stars because the product isn't PERFECT (see images attached) which most AmazonBasics products I've bought, in the past have been. I compared the hangers to the original ""Delta Baby Hangers"" (white) my daughter has had since she was born as well as ""Kid Sized Hangers"" from Ikea (blue) just to show customers a better idea of the size. I was concerned they were going to be a lot bigger, but couldn't tell from most of the pictures. They are actually standard baby size so they can fit baby clothes just fine! I love the velvet because it prevents my daughters clothes from slipping off like traditional plastic hangers. There were a couple defects like several of the hooks broke off when I tried to straighten the hooks (they came uneven), but if you're like me and don't care about a couple defects, then for the value, they are worth purchasing. Quick summary,

PROS:
- Great value for the quality
- Standard ""baby size"", i.e. can fit baby clothes
- For the most part, good quality
- PRIME shipping!

CONS:
- Hooks aren't straight
- Several hangers broke straight out the package
- Not a varied color selection (BLACK / WHITE!!!!), the polka dot ones look kind of tacky

Overall, I love Amazon products and will definitely be ordering more!"

I wrote a paper for a seminar class in college (I was an English major) on the coping mechanisms displayed by both Carrie and Danny Torrance (The Shining, Doctor Sleep). anyway as I was reading Carrie I thought, ""wow the scariest thing about her story isn't that she killed all those people with her powers, it's that there could be a lot of people out there like her who suffer greatly with no way to express or at least control how he or she feels. that's what made me empathetic toward Carrie. Yes it's a somewhat flawed story, but realistically told in the sense that a lot of kids Carrie's age have the same troubles. I'd read it again and if you like King in general read the one where it all started Carrie"

Books_5,0,"My highest compliment to a book is when I don't want to put it down - and that's how I felt about this book!  It was interesting from beginning to end.  The characters were believable with mostly realistic situations. The ending seemed a little forced with some unresolved issues--the chase and action on the bridge seemed forced and the whole Gill situation needed resolution.  Also the relationship between Randall with the sons could have been better developed.

It was a good story and kept my interest."

Just make sure you read the directions FIRST. But beware unless you have smooth walls it will not adhere, I have rough stucco walls in most of my house and paneling in another part and it will not stick properly. To over come this problem I used Blank Outlet covers made of plastic and than screwed the covers to the wall and installed this product to the blank covers, this method works good for iPhone 4 & 5 and similar sized phones.

Pet_Supplies_5,0,"This is my second time purchasing The Tree. My Flemish Giant peed on the first one and there was no way to clean it, since it's made with untreated wood and sisal. It's strong and well constructed, holding up to being gnawed and tossed around by a pretty large guy. There are no small parts for little mouths to swallow and choke on.

My bun tends to ignore his toys for a while (as in a few weeks) before deciding to play with them, and may even decide to ignore them again. That's definitely been the case with this toy, but the quality and the fact that it's made right here in the U.S. without questionable materials makes it worth the cost."
Books_5,0,"I don't remember the last time I read ""David Copperfield.""  I've heard it said that this book of Dickens' is somewhat autobiographical, but I don't know for sure.  One thing I've enjoyed since I bought my 3 Wordsworth Classics is the exposure to 18th century English culture through Dickens' wonderful prose.  ""David Copperfield"" will have to wait until ""Oliver Twist"" and ""Great Expectations"" had been read through first."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,"Excellent and bad. The overall look of the lamp is just too dull. The light is bright and doesn't move. The dimmer is too small and the light is too bright. The light is not bright enough to be visible in a dark room. This lamp is still very bright. I haven't used it with a dimmer, but I have seen it with a dimmer. I have had it for about a month now and it still works great. It's very easy to program and to program it is easy to change. You can set the brightness of the lamp by either clicking on the ""LED"" button or by pressing the ""program"" button. The light is bright enough to see in a dark room, but the dimmer is too small. It's also too small for a 3/4 inch lamp."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"So I just got these tonight. I didn't necessarily like the price per bulb but hey these are the best I found on Amazon for what I need. ..  I got these bulbs to replace some other LED candle porch light I bought about six months ago. I was going to update and give a really bad review for my last bulbs as they burnt out within six months from running them over night. You do the math but I think you'll find that doesnt add up to 10,000 hours. But that was the old bulbs. These new ones are a different company and style, they are round at the tip, without the fancy angled candle tip some have. But I'm willing to give up fancy tips for a bulb that lights well. It says soft white and it matches better to my other yellowish bulb than my previous bulbs that were more bright white. Hard to explain bulb color in the dark but I'll post some pics.

As mentioned, I barely got these bulbs, but was super impressed with the color vs my old bulbs.  It looks more like a soft porch light than my old. I plan to update at a future time, gotta make sure these babies last.  First impression is buy them, good porch light color, I'll warn you if they don't last."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"I moved into a new house that had been built about a year before.  For the past 17 months I have been changing batteries very often in my three CO detectors.  I finally started putting dates on the batteries and found that they only last 2 months (1 month in a cold basement).  I'm guessing I spent about $70 in batteries.  The batteries are only there to kick in when the AC power fails, which it rarely does and never for very long.  However, my tests indicate that the batteries are being drained while the AC power is properly working.

I contacted the company for warranty replacements and was told I would have to pay $20 for shipping & HANDLING to get my ""FREE"" warranty replacements.  I made a big stink and got them to send them at their expense.  Only time will tell if the replacements work.  Till then I can work on the problem of random beeps from my BRK smoke detectors.

Update: I could not take the random beeping any more.  I finally threw out (and replaced) all the BRK detectors (smoke & CO2) in the house and the random beeping finally stopped.  I will never buy another BRK product as long as I live."

They have been a great solution for a HOA, who has mailbox covered porches, but there is no power to run lighting at night. We installed 12 lights, 2 on each building. They seem to work well, as long as they charge during the day. When we installed them, we did have 2 lights that would not work. The company was great to respond and help us figure out what was going on and to ship us parts and a new light to take care of our customer. We will see how they do long term."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"Brilliant white with a small, subtle logo on the left chest instead of that old big logo some brands use. The seams and edging all around this shirt are well sewn and smooth, no seconds here. The v-neck style is actually cut too low for my husband's taste, he said it looks like some of my v-neck t-shirts - as in too feminine for him.

The shirt does run small though and despite not liking the v-neck, he would wear it anyway if it fit right. It's a little narrow in the shoulders for him and fits more like a small. Compared to the medium t-shirts in other brands, this one is cut differently. On the plus side, it fits me fine and the fabric is very soft, but he's right, that v is feminine."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"I hate buying tool accessories but this thing is great. It works as well as I do and saves time. I love the easy rise system but I had to make some metal mounts so it would work with my Hitachi first gen 8&1/2 inch sliding compound saw. I really didn't like setting up my saw for precision cuts before. It always took too long, too much stuff, and too much time. Now I just roll it into the truck and away I go and the supports slide out far enough to actually help. I would have preferred it be a little narrower, and as others have said, solid tires instead of inflatable. Its really heavy but it's easy to move around and saves me time every time I use the saw. Would buy another if this one broke."

The sound dampening is very good and the unit is comfortable to wear for long periods of time.  I expected the radio to be a poor performer based on other reviews, but found it to be decent for a shop environment.  A stand alone radio that I have been using has much poorer reception than this unit.

I was worried that the plastic would rub blisters on my sensitive skin but I could not have been more pleased. First of all, has anyone else mentioned that the shoes are scented? SCENTED! The plastic is not plastic, but more of a rubbery/vinyl/pvc flexible and comfortable material. Comfortable and totally worth it."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"Excellent product - best value in it's class, I believe. The lobster design is the warmest you can get and still have that index finger useable for shooting a rifle or whathaveyou.  Work equally well for winter skiing or extreme cold hunting."

Kindle_Store_5,0,"Oh my gosh, I think this is the best one of all. Dave and Amy are on their way to Nate's place and run into multiple violent encounters with Zombies, bad guys, the government, Alphas, and very harsh parents. I loved the interaction between Dave and Amy, they are becoming a Dad and daughter and it is so great seeing him teach her how to survive this world. On top of this we are learning much more about the Alphas and the Asura virus. Definitely need to read these in order and just take a deep breath and enjoy.  So good."
Toys_and_Games_5,0,"Dozen Doubloons is a pirate-themed card game for 1-4 players. As the name suggests, there are doubloons involved, and the number 12 is important. The first player to collect a dozen doubloons is the winner.

This game is attractively packaged and easy to play. To collect a doubloon, players must create the number twelve using cards in their hand or available cards on the table. Wild cards and 12 cards can give players an easy doubloon, and block cards can be used to hinder an opponent.

Dozen Doubloons has quickly become a new favorite among my children. I think one of the bigger draws for them is being able to collect the doubloons, but I know they also enjoy how easy the game is to understand while still challenging them to think and make decisions. Its not always easy to find a game that both of my children enjoy, so this game is definitely appreciated in our house.

As a light game to pass 10-15 minutes, I think Dozen Doubloons is a decent choice. It has a quick set-up and is easy to play. The game leans more on luck than strategy but still offers players various choices to make on their turn. Rules for playing a solitaire variation are also included on the rules sheet, and that is a fun choice for someone who has a few minutes alone and wants something to do.

As a parent, I also have to appreciate the educational value of this game. Being that my children are 5 and 7, they are both working on their addition facts, and the task of figuring out which cards can be used to add up to 12 has been of benefit to them both.

I received a free copy of this game in exchange for my honest review."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"I finally settled on Free-Run Duck among the various offerings of Origen treats.  My dog is highly motivated to obtain one or two, and they provide excellent training aids. However, they are expensive, and I'm not sure they are that much better than run of the mill, organic treats from the pet products stores.

Movies_and_TV_5,0,"The movie is hard to follow.  There are a lot of moving parts and hidden inuendos that are easy to miss the first time you watch the movie.  I watched it twice and the second time around, It made more sense and I could see more of the connections between the stories and the characters.  I think if I watched it again, I would be able to follow the story even better. The futuristic story of  Sonmi~451 and Hae-Joo Chang is my favorite.  It's such a powerful love story of two people from different worlds who come together to fuel a revolution. They find love and, in the end, sacrifice themselves for the cause. I also found the character of ""Old Georgie"" from the last story very haunting and entertaining.
If you watch the movie, watch it atleast twice or you just won't get it."

If you're not aware of what a proper connector should look like, or if durability is not a concern, then this certainly looks like a great deal. It's half the price of a quality part. And I've returned mine, because I'm not willing to save money at the expense of significant quality reduction. Yes these look like the connector you want. But don't be fooled. They're the Playskool version of the real thing. Great for display or demonstrations, but I won't use them to pass 30A of 230V.

Kindle_Store_5,0,"The Glimpsing is an intriguing and haunting tale of revenge, love, hope, faith, courage, and the age-old battle of good vs. evil.

The author creates a very Twilight Zone atmosphere from the beginning of the book, with nods to Alfred Hitchcock, Rod Serling and Stephen King. Although I wouldn't classify it as a horror story, it incorporates the psychological horror and suspense for which the above three are recognized as masters.

Portia Childress, brought up by a mother who has the ability to ""glimpse"", see into the world just beyond our world, wants the one thing she can't find in her relationships with men: true love. How she deals with this unfulfilled need is the center of this tale.
The mysterious painting reminds me of aspects of ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"" and subsequent stories involving mysterious, ""changing"" paintings but this has its own unique flavor.

It is easy to identify with Portia's innocence and need but more difficult to understand where she went as result of it. Gabrielle, in spite of her own love for Jack, tries to remain loyal to Portia and to love her best friend. Jack's increasing feelings for Gabrielle only complicate the situation, bringing about some of the ensuing horrors.

My favorite character in this story, though a minor one was Jack's housekeeper, Janice. She has the wisdom to get an idea of what is going on after Jack first receives the mysterious painting, offers Gabrielle a way of dealing with her own guilt and ultimately is willing to risk dealing with something she is worried is beyond her ability to handle, because of her belief in doing the right thing.

This was a refreshing read, standing out among the current ""horror"" stories that I have read with its unique presentation of that battle between good and evil. Well worth the time invested in reading the book. Unfortunately because it would give away spoilers, I can't go into the details of the unique perspective presented in this story, but I think any fan of the horror/supernatural realm would enjoy the book"

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"This review will be gross - but let's face it, completely required for what this product is.  I bought a couple of these swim diapers for my daughter to use in swim class, and they have been working wonderfully but have never been ""put to the test"".  Well today that all changed, and my daughter had a massive blow out at her swim class.  Not the easy to clean type of blow out either, liquidy, messy and disgusting (and utterly mortifying).  That being said, this diaper contained it.  I don't even know HOW it contained it.  My daughter's teacher literally lifted her out of the pool to give her to me to decontaminate her and she said, ""wow - this is a good swim diaper""."

Movies_and_TV_5,0,"Unfortunately, this movie is not very good.  Such an epic moment in time truly deserves a good movie, and I was suckered into watching this on the grounds that I may have stumbled upon one.  Well, there was a reason why I'd never heard of this movie, that reason being: because this movie is really bad at being a movie.  It's EXTREMELY hackneyed and cliched, and doesn't make that okay by being fun to watch.  It's not bad because it's an anti-war movie or for any political reasons, it's bad because it's boring and poorly put together as a film.  Maybe someday they'll make a good movie about The Battle of the Somme, but as of 2016, that day hasn't come."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"I used this to tap a custom wooden live center for my Jet 1642 lathe. It's just the right thread size for the threads on the stock live center, once you remove the cone. So I made something out of maple, drilled a 5/8"" hole in it, and tapped it with this. Then I poured in a bit of thin CA glue to strengthen the wooden threads and screwed the tap in one more time to cut the threads perfectly. Now I have a wooden live center to hold the back of bowls without piercing them. This tap was indispensable for that."

Toys_and_Games_5,0,"Boggle is a great word game that is fun for the whole family in which players have three minutes to find as many connected words as they can in a 4x4 grid.  It doesn't take long to play (only three minutes to be exact) and you don't need a lot of space to play it.  It uses a lot of the same skills as scrabble, but unlike in scrabble you won't keep getting beaten every time by that brainy uncle who must have memorized the dictionary, because most of the words that can be found are only 3 or 4 letters long, and even younger kids have a fair chance to win(occasionally a very long word can be found however - my personal triumph was the 8-letter ""nicotine"").  Also, you WILL learn new words you never knew existed from this game when people guess them and make you look them up - crazy words like ""hie"" and ""tat"" and ""coe"".  Overall a very fun game well worth buying, although I wish they still made the bigger version, because that one's a lot of fun too."

I would recommend them to anyone who is looking for a sound bar with a good sound quality.I got this to replace my iMac, but I've had issues with it, not just the front and back ports, but the keyboard.  It's been working flawlessly for over a year, and I've used it to type on my iPod Touch and to type on my Kindle Fire.  I've noticed it's not the best looking keyboard, but I haven't had any issues with it.  I've had the keyboard for a few months and it still works great.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"First off, this thing is big. If you don't have an application that requires a big, long spout, this is probably not a good choice for you. I did need one because I have a large soaker tub with a wide rim and a wall mounted faucet. It was really tough to find a long wall mounted spout that wasn't really expensive. I also wanted one without a diverter, but that just wasn't going to happen, so I settled on this one and just removed the diverter. The spout itself is pretty solid and installation was easy. You can install it in three ways: 1) with a short MPT stub, 2) with a long MTP stub, or 3) with a o-ring-sealed slip fit. My only complaint is that the quality of the finish is not great. There are visible cross-hatch marks in the finish. It's not scratched (if it was I would have returned it for a replacement). It appears to be just the way these are made - the metal is not getting polished to a sufficient degree. Unless you're a perfectionist like me, this probably won't bother you, but I wanted to mention it."
Kindle_Store_5,1,"I loved this story, Kayla has the chemistry and her dad is a killer. She's just a little stuck in the past. She needs to get over her past and move on. The story was well written and kept me engaged. I absolutely loved this book! I was given this book by a friend in exchange for an honest review."
Kindle_Store_5,0,"Very good book. I enjoyed this book. Keep writing and I will keep reading. Kept me interested. Just enough sex. It's fast-paced and suspenseful with sexy, gritty characters. I was hooked after the first chapter!  All of the characters were written extremely well. There were some edge of my seat moments, and some super hot sexy moments. Overall, this book had everything Im looking for in a romantic suspense.

Electronics_5,1,"I lost the sound in my old computer. I've tried a lot of different products and they all worked fine. I am using this with the TRS-80 and it's just as good as the old one I had. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a new laptop. Works great. I did not want the cable to fall out of the charger. I didn't want the cable to be bent over and on my desk. It's very easy to insert and close the charger. You can use the cable as a micro USB cable, or just plug it into a wall outlet. I like this case because it has the included charger that you plug into the wall outlet. It's a bit small to carry around and I don't have to worry about it falling off the charger."

Kindle_Store_5,0,It starts with a young women coming out of a drugged like daze walking across a parking lot to a car she doesnt recognize but has the keys to it in her pocket. She wants to go home but has no idea where that might be.  As she starts driving she sees a highway sign that she thinks looks familiar so she turns on to it in the direction that she thinks might take her home.  After hours of driving she pulls up to a house she thinks is her home and knocks on the door.  The door is opened by her shocked husband and finds out shes been gone for seven months and has no memory of where shes been or why.  The next day she tells her husband that she wants to retrace her route to see where shes been and why. Now things really get strange but interesting. Its a really good plot and worth reading.

Books_5,0,"I have read most of the books and all of the movies. It is amazing how Tolkien describes his characters. The elves fair and graceful, I would prefer this type to bring me presents during Christmas. Men some unwise and others wise. A perfect description of reality! And how he created the Elvish languge is extraordinary! Also a great allegory, he perfectly depicted the real stuggle between good and evil .Though he may have meant it that way or no. It's a awesome series."
Kindle_Store_5,0,"Damien and Nikki are happily married and living life in domestic bliss. Or, at least they are until some unnamed, faceless person decides to play with Nikki and Damien again, by emailing them pictures of Damien in the throes of passion with someone else. But this nameless, faceless faction doesn't stop there. This person then moves on to sending Jamie, Nikki's best friend, a video of her in the throes with her former neighbor Douglas, who, unbeknownst to all his many conquests, films their sexual escapades on his laptop. Clearly, his video bank had been breeched, because, as it has been stated many times, Douglas wouldn't be able to hack his way out of a paper bag, even with directions.
But this huge annoyance (which isn't solved, btw, which leads me to believe that there will be more Damien and Nikki), is overshadowed by the true heart of the story. Valentines Day. Ms. Kenner certainly has a way with writing romance, and I can only hope that my first Valentines Day as a married woman with a man who owns pretty much the entire world is as romantic as Nikki's was with Damien.
Their celebration starts a few days early with a scavenger hunt, taking Nikki back to all of the places she and Damien have been to and loved in the past. The end result is a three day weekend at a private resort in the Bahamas, before coming back home to a few more surprises.
Despite having a few guesses as to who is behind this blackmail scheme, this was a very, very romantic book. Heavy on the between the sheets (or lounge chair) action.
We also got to, briefly, meet Jackson Steele, who is the first character in the Stark Universe series, which is coming out Spring of 2015.
Overall, another wonderful chapter to the Nikki and Damien story."

You can switch it to a ""seconds"" setting where it will count up seconds of the actual time it is, but you cannot start a timer that will count up minutes. I do really like the watch though, it's comfortable -- that's huge for me because I usually can't wear things on my fingers or wrists for a long time and I've had the watch on already for two days.

Pet_Supplies_5,0,"This is a generous portion of cat food with a lot of higher quality ingredients compared to other types of cat food. Primarily, the first ingredient is actual chicken and it includes taurine. It also does not include grains of any kind and, as anyone knows about cat nutrition, grains are not a part of anything a cat needs in its diet. They are junk food and fillers so the primary selling point of this product is that it provides what your cat needs to be healthy without things which it does not need or that can damage its health. So, I'm very pleased with the ingredients list for this product, though I will note that one pays a premium price for the quality.

I can't speak to whether or not the nutrition is as good as the ingredients list indicate it should be, but I can say my cat throws up less after eating this than some other types of food. I can also say that she tends to rapidly lose interest in dry food that I feed her and has held interest in this longer than other types of dry food. I don't know if she's finding it more appetizing (possible, since it has a strong smell and she seems to like stronger smelling food) or if not having digestive issues after eating it makes her favor it.

In terms of value, if my cat continues to eat this up over time, I will keep buying it because, though it may be more expensive, if she will actually eat all of it and I don't have to throw out uneaten food, it'll save me money in the long run."

I have screwed the battery compartment in tightly, still it wouldnt come on unless i gave it that extra push. I know my son (whom I purchased it for) wouldn't be happy with this product. Please send me a replacement controller if possible."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"OK...I have been carrying every known backpack since 1976 when I joined the Army, Rangers and Special Forces.  I was skeptical of buying a Badlands backpack...I've never had a backpack this small (compared to a SOF CFP-90, Dana, Mystery Ranch)  But this backpack is perfect for a bow hunter.  I have not purchased the Bow Boot...I will...but this is just big enough to carry everything I need to stalk into my tree, put up my stand and then pull out all my ""warmies"" and get comfortable for the days hunt.  The straps give you options to tie things on the backpack...even without the Bow Boot...I can safely secure my bow to the backpack.  I can even use the side straps...that have a weird configuration...but are perfect to strap the backpack to my Lone Wolf Alpha Tec or Lone Wolf Sit and Climb platform with shoulder straps on the frame and hike them both in.  I normally leave the stand and hunt it three days and then just backpack the pack in and out.  The pockets are innovative.  It took me a while to lay out all of my equipment and find a proper spot for them but I have been able to put in...Rattle and Roll Rattle, Deer Grunt Call, Binoculars, extra knife, knife sharpener, cleaning gloves, Laser Range Finder, Bottle to Drink, Bottle to get rid of Drink, Deer Camera, Tree Saw, Rain Jacket, Rain Paints, Vest, Sweater, Extra Cold Weather Gloves, Baseball hat, Tree Screw, 3D roll of fabric.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Motion sensors are great for different areas around the house.  Couple of places we use them for are in the garage/storage rooms.  Basically a place you're going to go into often that you don't want to have to flip a light.  Works great when carrying something.  The other place that works well is a pantry/bathroom.

There are a couple of modes here that are nice, including the ambient mode which basically will not trigger if the room is already light enough, this is pretty great.  You can also trigger it on manually which is great if you know you are going to be in a room for awhile and are worried about the sensor picking you up (although this sensor is quite sensitive -- and has different settings for the size of the room).

Books_5,0,"The cover art of headless viewers watching television says it all. My only brush with the late Neil Postman came when he spoke at the university I was attending in the northwest. A breezy east coaster, he was unaware of the need to step on eggs. During the questions, one woman said, ""Mr. Postman, how can we help children have self-esteem?"" to which he replied, ""I don't want them to have self-esteem; I want them to esteem something other than themselves.""

After the stunned silence I and a few others rose and started clapping; it was very much as if life had been returned to Pepperland in Yellow Submarine. I've been clapping inwardly ever since, as when I read this book.

There are hundreds of reviews of this book, which created a stir everywhere. Everyone (except the people running TV) seems to have read it. Most readers find it smooth going. However, those who don't want to tackle the book can still wrestle with the ideas. In Postman's essay collection, Conscientious Objections, he replies to the question ""Why are books so long?"" with the answer that they don't have to be, and as an example gives a short version of this book.

The basic thesis is that along with George Orwell's 1984 in which civilization lapses into a dystopia (opposite of a utopia) ruled by oppression and violence, there was the opposite vision in Aldous Huxley's Brave New World that society would be destroyed by indulgence in pleasure. Postman says that while you can make a good case for the first view, the second is in full swing. Now if only the desperate networks would read this book and (re)turn to making good TV."

I highly recommend this book to everyone!This was a great book. I love the fact that the characters were both strong and independent. I thought the author did a great job of bringing the characters together and getting them to fall in love. I was given a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. This is a great quick read. It is short but it has all the elements needed to get you into the story. It is well written and you will not be disappointed. It will keep you turning pages.

The only problem is that it's kind of hard to put the collar on.  The front part is very loose, and the back is very loose.  The only way to get it on is to bend it around and put it back on.  That's a pretty tough job, and it's been a lot of trouble since I got it.  I'm not sure I"

Pet_Supplies_5,1,Love these wipes!  My dog has been using them for a month now and they smell great!  I have not had any issues with fleas but the spray does not take up much of the smell. It does not clump on the carpet as I expected. The only thing I would say about these is that they are a bit big for a dog that is a bit small for a puppy. I like the fact that they are not all that hard to put on and it is easy to clean. The only thing I would say is that I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a long lasting brush.

Movies_and_TV_5,1,"I'm not saying the storylines are bad, but the plots are either boring or just plain boring. The story is basically the same as the first film, except with a different cast. The movie takes place in the future where the earth is being destroyed. This movie is still very good, but the story is completely different."
Books_5,0,"I will never say that I am too tired, or that I cannot do or take it anymore. My new hero is Regina Calcaterra, a proud Long Islander, who rises to the top despite every misgiving that could be thrown at a child. Despite what the authorities told hershe survivedfinished high school, went to college while working several jobs, and became a lawyer.
Im standing and clapping right now.
Etched in Sand is an eye-opening account of Regina and her four siblingsall with different fatherslife struggles through the foster care and child protective system. This isn't TV where everything is honky-dory. This story brings to lighta foster care system that is broken and full of holes. This is real life and how the lowest form of human beings abuses the system.
Regina lived in the shadows of a heinous, abusive, (add any horrible word you can think of here), and neglectful mother while fending for them self. Dumpster diving for food and clothes; sleeping five across the back seat of a car, or in the trunk when they could. Despite living through the most horrible conditions, anyone could put to wordsRegina, with some help from her two older siblings manages to raise and keep her family together.
When Reginas mother is not out on her month-on-end drinking and sex bingesshe is beating and humiliating Regina to the brink of death. Why you ask? Because the dirt bag of a man who fathered Reginano names here, you have to read it for yourselfleft before Regina was even born. Regina eventually proves who her father was, but she had to live with her mothers wrath every day since he left.
Yes, Regina is my new hero and the foster care and child protective services system will be a better place because of her.

Books_5,0,I have to confess I bought this book for my 4 yr. old daughter and ended up keeping it for myself! It's still in the family so I think it's okay--besides I think she's a bit young for it! I bought it because I thought it would be inspirational for my young daughter and as I started reading through it I found it inspiring myself. I love the way the artist's talk about their experiences with art. I also enjoyed looking at the art they created when they were young. Many of the artists also give bits of inspiring words for the young artists to think about. I think this book would be a wonderful gift for a young inspiring artist or anyone who enjoys art!

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"I bought this bag for my average-souse 10-year-old daughters first time doing summer swim team. Its a pretty bag but she doesnt look silly carrying it. It turns out most kids actually have the Speedo Teamster bag, which is a little larger with more pockets. After the first week of morning practice I was convinced we made the right choice. The bag held her towel, a change of clothes, and a pair of running shoes with room to spare.
However, after meets started, Im less convinced of this batman perfection. Apparently, you need a towel to sit on, and a towel to dry off with, and if you have two hours between races, you don't want to try off with the same cold wet towel you used earlier. So you definitely need 2 towels, preferably 3. And it might be pretty cool by the time the meet is over so a shorts outfit AND a sweatpants outfit gets packed. Plus things like goggles, sunglasses, regular glasses, money, sunblock, etc. At that point, this bag isn't quite big enough and definitely doesnt have enough pockets. Daughter has started packing small things in gallon ziplocks so they can be thrown in the large compartment without getting wet or lost among the towels  of which shes just been making do with two because three big fluffy towels will just not fit.

The other thing that should be noted is how the bag hangs. It curves, so the mesh pocket ends up parallel to the ground, and if you try to put a water bottle in there its going to fall out. Goggles and swim cap and lip balm are fine in there, and thats what she needs to access the quickest when she gets to the pool so it works, but a dedicated water bottle pouch would be nice.  So while I LIKE this bag, and the quality seems good, it might not be the best bag for our needs. If it bites the dust and daughter keeps swimming, Id probably replace it with a Teamster."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Nice quality light... everything looks great and is well made. A few complaints though...

First complaint was there were no installation instructions included. Even the website didn't offer any help, offering just an email to contact.

Second, this was apparently designed to be attached directly to the ceiling and not to a ceiling electrical box as it did not come with the right parts. The cover for the ceiling was also barely big enough to cover the standard-size box I had. After messing around with extra screws and brackets, I did manage to get it installed quite nicely, no thanks to the included accessories.

Third, the set screw that you tighten down to hold the cord in the lamb base is nylon and stripped out with almost no pressure.

Overall, it looks fantastic, but the installation procedure was ridiculous."

I think it's fair to say that the author does a great job of making this a great book, but I don't think I'd recommend it highly. I just didn't care for it as much as I did the first time I read it. I'm glad I gave it a chance, because I really loved it and it was great!

Overall, I really liked this book. It was a good read. I'm not a big fan of historical fiction, but this was a good read for me.I didn't like the ending.  It was a bit abrupt, but I really liked the book.  I wish the author had given a little more detail about what the characters were up to.  I think the ending was a bit of a cliffhanger.

Books_5,0,"Dog lover might be an understatement for my fascination with this species but this book only reinforces my tenuous claim to sanity in light of the fact that seven dogs currently live with me. The fact that we can trust these animals with our confidences and emotional turmoil much more than most of our human companions is substatiated in Katz' writings about dogs. They are trusting and loving to a fault and yet do demand a commitment from us that far too many people do not take seriously. Thus we hear, ""It's only a dog."" The lessons learned by children and adults from dogs are important and should not be ignored or downplayed by the,""only a dog"" remark. They too love, feel pain and joy, and  suffer many of the travails of their human counterparts. For many children, coping with the loss of their dog is the first experience of death. A dog may also be their biggest source of comfort in the loss of another family member. The importance of this partnership should never be downplayed and Katz treats this with respect and brings it to light especially for those poor ""dogless"" people."

Books_5,0,"I believe there are more than enough reviews here to decifer whether or not you plan to read this  charming, witty and candid book. However, as an Australian raised in both Europe and America, I must heed a warning to those of you who read the negative reviews by Europeans and Asians. DO NOT LISTEN TO THEM!! They obviously lack a sense of humour and the ability to laugh at themselves (unlike Bryson).  Bryson can be provincial at times, but he is so charming indeed! One who has traveled for days in a foreign land can understand his exhaustion and frustration and will howl with laughter.
Yes, Bryson at times can be brutally honest with his opinion of foreign countries and their inhabitants and culture, but they are HIS OPINIONS and they are frankly FUNNY and quite observant. I suppose those who take offense to his opinions neglected to understand that Bryson is a brazen self critic  and will unabashedly admit to his lack of sophistication due to his stereotypical midwestern American upbringing. Please take no notice to the malevolence of the quazi-sensitive and humourless French and Germans who negatively reviewed this charming and engaging work.
Give the man a break and give this book a READ...Unless you possess absolutely no sense of humour, you will find it quite enjoyable!"
Toys_and_Games_5,0,"Oh, my, this is so much fun.  My grandson is at my house playing with this toy right now.  When you push the center gear, all of the lights start flashing, music plays, and the gears (if they are still on the monkey) start spinning.  What I like about the toy is that the gear mechanism spin whether or not the gears are on or off and my grandson can put them on and pull them off without stopping the unit.  He loves monkeys, so this toy is perfect for him.

While I like learning toys, sometimes you just want a fun toy to play with.  This one accomplishes both - it is really fun and there is an opportunity to learn colors and improve fine motor control.  The inside gears are in the same colors as the flashing lights.  The outside gears are in similar colors.  You can play match the colors or you can mix them up on purpose.  I also noticed that the little balls that come with his other toys can sit atop the spinning gears and the balls spin, too!  Add to that the gears and knobs are just the right size for his one year old hands and he likes to chew them as he is now teething his last two canine teeth (he's already got 14 of his teeth) and the gears seem to hit just the right spot for those last two.

The toy is a lot more fun that I expected and I would not hesitate to give it as a gift or to buy for the little one in your life."

Books_5,0,"DFW deserves a better biographer ... this book reads like a very long Wikipedia article.  I applaud Max for doing original research (interviews, etc.) and roughly half of the information in this book was new to me, but I feel like he should have spent way more time actually WRITING a biography rather than collating a bunch of letters and interviews without really analyzing his subject.  I never get the sense that the author is anything more than a mediocre journalist, or a member of a particularly active DFW list-serv who decided that he wanted to write a book---except that he didn't actually know anything about writing biographies."

Books_5,0,"Having watched RAI's Montalbano television series (with Luca Zingaretti's outstanding performances as the eccentric inspector), I was expecting to find the novels familiar and boring. Not at all, not in the least. The TV series excel in giving us the visual feel of the exteriors: the superb cast of delightful characters; and the beauty of Camilleri's fictional town of ""Vigta"" in the fictional district of ""Montelusa"" (actually the Sicilian city of Ragusa, Italy, and surrounding towns). The novels give us what TV cannot, the interiors, the feelings and cogitations of the uniquely unpredictable Montalbano and the reactions of those around him. As Montalbano's faithful (and unusually astute) detective, Fazio, says to himself in ""The Snack Thief,"" his boss didn't become insane, he was insane from birth. The novels reinforce TV's visual charm and delicious performances with the ""insides"" of the plots, people, and places. In many ways, ""Voice of the Violin"" is the most noir of the series--plot and counter-plot turn the unraveling into a delicious concerto of criminality. One can hear the gears and the arpeggios whirling about in Salvo brain. Camilleri's novels are such a delight to read, I imagine Montalbano's police force colleagues, friends and lovers, even his opponents (criminal and bureaucratic), who lived the plots with him, would enjoy these books. And Montalbano? He'd read the novels and then ask Camilleri, half-serious, half-mocking, ""So, why are you always busting my balls?"""

Books_5,0,"The Forgotten Jesus helped me exchange my Western viewpoint of scripture for that of a Torah-faithful Jew. Gallaty doesnt reinterpret the Bible, rather he explains the significance and symbolism of Jesus words, actions, and the Rabbinical methods of instruction he employed. By doing so, he made connections and provided insights which I wouldn't have made on my own.

It took me a few days to tackle roughly 200 pages of text (not counting the reading plan or extensive endnotes) because I read with my Bible open and a notepad ready. At the end, I am left with 24 post-flags and two pages of shorthand notes Id like to discuss with my book group. Not since reading Sitting at the Feet of Rabbi Jesus (co-authored by Ann Spangler and Lois Tverberg) have I been so completely enthralled by the community and culture of first-century Judaism. I cannot wait to encounter these portions of scripture in my reading plan with fresh eyes. Highly recommend!

Electronics_5,1,"I bought this to replace a bulky, wide-angle lens that I had for a Nikon D50.  I had a Canon D810 and the Canon D8100, and it was a bit of a pain to replace a Canon D850.  This lens is far superior to the Canon D750.

I did not want to be the one to buy this lens.  I just wanted a lens that I could use for my D810 and a camera that I could use for my D8100.  I have a Canon D810 and it works great.  I have a Nikon D810 and this lens does exactly what it is supposed"

I had to replace a meter that was running out of batteries.  This is a very good magnetix.  I am very pleased.I bought this to replace a broken one I had.  I love the color and the fact that the hose is a little longer than I expected.  This one has a nice white finish.  I like that the hose is longer than the one I had.  The hose has a small, rubber ring that helps keep it clean.  I am really happy with this purchase.

I would not recommend this to anyone except those that have other uses for this product.  I just bought this for my family and"
Kindle_Store_5,0,"I wish this prequel would've been out before ""Seduce Me,"" part 1.  This prequel gives some of the background on the main characters, Ashley and Brandon, in ""Seduce Me.""  And, includes the reasoning behind the actions taken in the next installment."

Movies_and_TV_5,1,"Massimo Troisi's last work as a director, the movie is a cold war thriller, a war film. The film is set in a small town where a couple of lonely, wealthy women go to a bar and get drunk. The movie is set in an idyllic town with no bank, no TV, and no supermarket. There is a man who lives with his wife and children and has a small group of friends who go to the bar and buy drinks for him. He goes into the bar and buys a gun and runs away."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,Great quality and price. We use it at the beach and it does not leak. I have one in my glove

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,Price was right.  Fit well.  Comfortable.  Not much to get excited about over plain cotton underwear but I still gave it a 5 star rating.
Electronics_5,0,"It almost hurts to write a two star review for this speaker.  It's beautifully crafted and sounds great.

However, the auto-off function is a deal breaker, so this is going back.  I have battery powered Bluetooth speakers that don't have this ""feature""; why Polk decided to include it in an AC powered speaker makes no sense.  Further, when I power the speaker on, it doesn't automatically connect to the last known device.  I have to go back to my iMac every time and tell it to connect to the speaker.

Also, I haven't been able to keep the Airplay connection working for more than a few minutes.  I suppose this could be due to any number of factors, so I can't put this squarely on Polk, but that was one of the primary reasons I selected this particular model."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,"Lasted a grand total of $8,500+ in 2015.  This is a great value"
Toys_and_Games_5,0,"This is such a cute little fake guitar.  It is push button rather than anything with real strings.  You play it by pushing the button where you would normally strum the guitar and you do ""fret"" work by pushing down on the interior of the fret section of the guitar.  There is a flip section that alternates the music between electric and acoustic.

My grandson is almost 18 months old and doesn't really know who Dora is as he watches very little on TV (and then only a couple of specific DVDs.)  We do, however, play a lot of instruments amongst the family - just in my house along there are over a dozen different instruments.  He even has a small ukelele of his own at his house that he plays with.  He grabbed the Dora guitar as soon as I showed it to him and showed him which buttons to push.  He ""played"" guitar all afternoon - carrying it around with him everywhere.  He would stop and start dancing and shaking his head to the tunes or would drop the guitar to clap - and then realize that he had to play it again to make the music continue.

The final move of the day was when he put it in his pop-up castle (along with his much beloved Fisher-Price piano keyboard) where it will wait until next week when he comes to my house again.  He loved it and played with it for hours.  His smile was so big, I wondered if it hurt his face to keep it up all afternoon. I'll probably pull out one of my guitars and then we can rock out together.

This is a really cute toy guitar and I recommend it highly.  I don't know why it is recommended for 3 years and up.  I don't see any small pieces that could be a hazard and my little guy loved it at 18 months."
Toys_and_Games_5,1,"Purchased this set for my son. He loves it. We also have the Clue. He loves the music. He also loves the game. The game is fun to play. It's a little difficult for him to learn and learn to play but he gets bored after about 15 minutes. Overall, I'd recommend this set to anyone looking for a fun and easy game. I highly recommend it to any young kid who loves to play music. This toy is amazing! It's the perfect size for my little girl and she loves it! She loves it. The colors are bright, vibrant, and it's easy to use. It's a fun little toy for my little girl, who has no interest in playing with it. I would recommend it for a 3 year old, but she can't seem to get enough of it."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"I don't have a problem with the product itself but it is packaged in a flimsy, unsealed, cardboard box and the small carbon flecks leak out of the packaging.  This ruined some of the other items that were shipped with it in an earlier order, so now I am very careful what other items I purchase at the same time."
Toys_and_Games_5,0,My grandson loves his Cars cars and Mater is a must-have for any child who loves the movie.  He especially loved attaching McQueen and other cars to Mater's tow hook.  I only with the hook was a bit sturdier.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,This is an extremely well-crafted item that contains high quality materials.  The preciseness of this instruments lends it to making fine and accurate measurements.  Highly recommended.

Kindle_Store_5,0,"Even though this book seems to talk about how to communicate a girl, I found that this book can be used for anyone for things other than ""seducing a girl"". Knowing how to communicate and how to use eye contact right is a skill that anyone should have. And I found a lot of great tips and fun exercises included in this book to help you train your eye contact and make it better and more powerful. The exercises in this book are definitely worth looking into. For example, Robert teaches you how to take a shower by alternating the temperatures of the water to train your eye contact, which is a bit challenging and fun to experiment. I've learned so much about ""high-status eye contact"" and am convinced by the book that it is so important for everyone to have this type of eye contact whenever we want to deliver powerful and persuasive messages."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"I have my weapons in a locked case, disassembeled, with a slide lock and a trigger guard.

My guns are not self defence weapons.  I know this seems like overkill but I have 2 boys that I'd like to keep in one piece.

This lock has good build quality but I would not reccomend it for home defence.  The key is small and would be difficult to open in an emergency.  I also think the tendency would be to want to keep the key near the gun for an emergency.  This totally defeats the purpose of a trigger lock.

This is a good lock for weapons storage."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,I bought this because Chef's Illustrated has the best recipe boards out there.  I have been using this for a while
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"Worth every penny.  This product will pay for it's self many times over.  Just the cost of going to the range, ammo and time.  Not to mention the muscle memory that can be achieved by the regular practice of this system.  Very high quality.  Don't let the plastic fool you.  I have a Glock 43 and this practice pistol fits on top of the real pistol perfectly.  The weight is very close.  Not having lead bullets in it makes it slightly lighter but the grip, sights and similar weight is about the same as dry fire practice with the real pistol.  The big advantage is that the laser lets you see exactly where your shot is at.  I practice around my bedroom at night when I get home from work.  While my wife sleeps and my skill has improved in a very short time.  I can hit the closet door hinges, center of the door handle, item in the master bath you name it dead on.  It allows me to work on my grip, form and aim with out disturbing anyone or any thing.  Think of the money I am saving.  When I do go to the range I expect to see big improvements and be able to stay in shape when I don't have time to shoot live.  Well worth the price for the convenience and realistic feel."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"When I got around to wearing them, they fit, but the shoe laces were different colors and had different lengths. The left shoe lace was so short it would not form a proper bow and would not stay tied."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"I know it indicates that these measure a 1/4-inch, but having a visual would be would be useful. So it would be nice if Amazon included an image showing these in an earlobe to give a better indication of their size. They are quite a bit smaller than I expected. As someone else mentioned, they would work perfectly in a second piercing, as they are about the size of a stud. That said, they are cute, but I probably would not have gotten them if I knew how small they were. Also, they look a bit crude to me. I got a fleur de lis necklace when I was in New Orleans and it is so beautifully made, with a lot of attention to detail. I did not think these had nearly that same level of detail or refinement."

Movies_and_TV_5,0,"It was delightful watching this old film, black and white, bad transfer and all.

Four bad guys are on their way to East Africa to secure a deal with uranium mines. Their agent is Billy (Humphrey Bogart) a man who is a ""typical rare spirit."" His wife is Maria (Gina Lollobrigida). They meet a British couple who are also on their way to Africa. Gina falls for the husband Harry (Edward Underdown) while Harry's wife Gwendolen (Jennifer Jones) falls for Billy. They are stranded in Italy as the boat is in need of repairs and the captain is always full of spirits.

Jennifer Jones steals this film as a fast thinker with an over active imagination who is prone to lying in every situation. The dialouge, in part written by Truman Capote, reflects national stereotypes that translate into today's world as well as clever oxymorons, mispronounced words and misused phrases. It is film in which you want to pay close attention to the words. The bad guys are quite the lot. Peter Lorre plays Julius O'Hara, claiming ""There are a lot of German O'Hara's from Chile."" Maj. Jack Ross (Ivor Barnard) spouts off his love for Hitler and Mussolini along with wild conspiracy ideas. Would make for a wicked remake."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"I don't have sleep apnea, but I sometimes snore at night. In addition to using nasal strips, I purchased this made-in-America SLEEP JOY BLUEFLEX GEL MEMORY FOAM CONTOUR PILLOW to help cut down on my snoring. As the name suggests, this pillow isn't a traditional shaped pillow and is contoured. Depending on how you place the pillow, one of the bumps is larger than the other one. This is not a full gel pillow or a full memory foam pillow. Instead, this pillow is mostly composed of memory foam that is covered in a layer of gel foam.

I have used this pillow for about six months. It has helped cut down on the snoring I do at night. In terms of comfort, the SLEEP JOY BLUEFLEX GEL MEMORY FOAM CONTOUR PILLOW is usually a pretty comfortable pillow. However, occasionally there are times when I find the contour shape to be uncomfortable, such as when I was sick or when I have had a very busy and stressful day at work and my neck is already sore.

Overall, the SLEEP JOY BLUEFLEX GEL MEMORY FOAM CONTOUR PILLOW is a comfortable and relaxing pillow. Just be aware that its not 100% memory foam or gel foam."

Pet_Supplies_5,0,"I have spent a fortune on eco, -organic, USA made toys.
Nope! he's gotta have his foam golf balls! And not the one with the feather glued to the top.
He kills then carries a ball between his corner teeth. At 4:00 AM. He drops it on a bedside rug. I am supposed to admire his kill, revive it (I guess) and throw it down the steps like a Slinky (boing-boing-boing-boing!) (well, they don't ""boing"" but they bounce!). If I sleep through ""Pink Ball"", it is placed on the rug while he hunts for ""Blue Ball"". ""Blue Ball"" is usually dead and on the rug by about 4:12 AM (just enough time to fall back asleep if I fake slept through ""Pink Ball"". ). Well, if dumb Mommy sleeps through ""Blue Ball"" presentation then it is placed ~6 inches to the right of ""Pink Ball"" and off we go for ""Yellow Ball"". Repeat.
I have sent text pix to insomniac friends to prove he will line them up precisely 6"" apart and equidistant from the rug edges. They look at the time stamps.
I wonder what evolutionary predatory advantage the placement confers?? I am just glad that Amazon has these. They are getting harder and harder to find in the original texture/size.
Hmmm....he sure does, ahem, lose these a lot!?! I wonder where they go??
He does like new ones that are kitty fuzz free (now he knows how we feel; oh, I guess their prey is hairy...not his concern..).
Note: Be careful w/ these around med/lg sized dogs. They can be partially inhaled/stick in back of throat  or swallowed and get stuck at various places in GI tract with $$$ to lethal outcomes. (DVM of 30+ yrs)."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,1,"Very nice jumper, used it for an overnight trip to Spain. Nice for the price, but a little too tight around the ankles. The neckline is a bit loose, but it's okay. I would definitely buy this again. I love this dress. The material is soft and comfortable."

I heard microfiber sheets are better for people w/allergies and they don't trap moisture like cotton sheets, so you don't wake up during the night hot/cold, hot/cold. They are lightweight and seem very well made so I give them 5 stars on both--I'm hoping after a few washings I can say the same about durability!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"Got this product to do our upstairs (only area that is carpeted in our home). Ordered on sale, and got the item promptly through Amazon. Fast forward to 4 months later (we never took it out of the box) and opened it to get to work since we were expecting company. Instructions were horrendous, but finally got the thing put together. My husband and I couldn't figure out why the vac was not standing upright on its own, but kept falling backwards. Figured something must be missing and/or not put together properly. We dumped the Hoover box upside down in an effort to see if there were any missed parts and the only thing that fell out was a teeeeennnnyyyy tiny piece of plastic (think size of a marble). Turns out that little piece of plastic had a big job-it held up the ENTIRE machine. A bit stunned that some genius thought plastic would be good to use for such a crucial part of the machine, I called Hoover expecting them to stand behind their ""One Year Warranty"" that the machine came with. Explained the situation to a Hoover rep who assured me that we could take it to an authorized Hoover store for free repair. I was also confident since the machine was not even used once that the Hoover store could verify that clearly this had not been our fault. Wrong again. We got a phone call 2 days later informing us that the plastic piece that was broken was NOT covered under warranty and it would cost $120.00 to fix. ARE YOU SERIOUS?!?? Oh yes, let's pay for a piece of (*#&(W*#&( machine twice. I think not. This has been the worst experience and I will NEVER purchase anything Hoover again. Cheap plastic, poor design, horrible customer service. Lesson learned the hard way, hope others can learn from our mistake. What a joke!!!! Hoover gets a F- in my book."
Books_5,0,"This review is specifically about the leather-bound Easton Press edition, for those who are contemplating buying this version.  It really is a beautiful looking book.  It is bound in rust-brown full leather, with orange and metallic gold ornamentation on the front cover and spine, with all page edges gilt.  (On the scan I have entered onto Amazon, the gold stamping looks very dull; it's difficult to scan reflective metallic colours.  The appearance of the book when seen in person is much more brilliant that the photo suggests.)

This edition measures six-and-a-half by nine inches in size, is 204 pages in length, and contains numerous black-and-white line drawings by Kay Nielsen.  It also contains full-colour plates by the artist---HOWEVER---here is the problem.  There were 25 paintings done for the original edition of this book, and the Easton Press edition only contains eight of them.  I cannot imagine why on earth this ""luxury"" edition of the book doesn't contain all of the colour plates; I'm totally baffled by the omission of nearly two-thirds of the artwork.  If not for that fact, this really would be the perfect edition of the book to own.  But as it is, I don't know that this Easton edition is worth the price."
Kindle_Store_5,0,"My son is pretty hyperactive and has some issues with attention. The list of treatments especially natural which is always good rather than drugs is very nicely done. Also a lot of information of whether the child is autistic or ADD  is around and this list helps the people get out of the ""autistic"" mindset which can potentially affect the children and the parents when wrongly informed of the same. We went through the pain and hence the concern. I recommend this heavily for any one especially parents who have concerns about their child by themselves or from the outside."

Electronics_5,0,"I'm running this 4 port USB hub PCMCIA card on an old Dell Inspirion 8600 laptop that is driven by Windows XP.  When installed, XP failed to recognize the hub and showed an error on the hardware install. However, the hub works anyway and every device that I've connected to the hub installs and/or is recognized right away.  I notice an annoying squeaky electronic sound whenever I connect a device to the hub but it does not seem to effect system or software operation so I live with it.  In hind sight I'd recommend getting a simple 2 port hub card for a laptop, this one is really overkill for my purposes."
Electronics_5,0,"These JBL Stereo Headphones (ear buds, really) have brought music back to my ears.  Since losing most of the hearing in one ear (and about 20% in the other), my experience of music was drastically altered.  Stereo became an aberrant mono, movement became stuck in place, and range became unpleasantly narrow.  Amazingly, these headphones compensate for much of that, and music sounds rich and clean once more.  I cannot explain the acoustics that make this happen, but I am thoroughly surprised by and appreciative of it.  (The first music I listened to was a pre-hearing loss favorite  Van Morrisons Poetic Champions Compose.  The alto and soprano saxophones have reclaimed their divinity.)  The rated frequency response is 10  22K hertz.  The buds are comfortable and fit securely; I did not need to use the optional silicone tips.

By the way, I periodically clean the bud tips with a nearly dry, non-alcohol, fragrance-free baby/body wipe.  You might notice any human dirt with each use, but the grubbiness does build up over time."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"This is well made and comfortable. The color is less bright than in the photo, but only slightly and I like the color very much. It's flattering with my silver hair. I bought a large instead of medium because I know that Columbia coats run small on me. It fit perfectly. The fabric is lighter than I expected because all of my other fleece jackets are thicker. However, for Southern California, this works very well as a top layer when it's a little cooler in the morning. For example, when I want to walk in the early morning and it's a bit too chilly for just a top, this works well. It goes with all my work out clothes and also looks good with jeans, shorts, and T-shirt dresses. I got a great deal on this color, and I'm glad I got it instead of the charcoal color I had been looking for."

He is 6 years old and loves this.  He likes it because it is big and it is made of wood.  It does a good job of holding up to the wind and I think it will be a great addition to our home.

This is the story of Lindsay and Ty.
Lindsay is a veterinarian, a job she loves.
Ty is a rancher, a job he loves.
They had met at college but they weren't an item.
Years later, he runs into Lindsay again. The chemistry is still there, and Ty is determined to not let Lindsay get away again.
Things happen with Lindsay that makes her pull away from Ty. She ends all contact with him.
After not seeing her for 14 months, Ty runs into her once again at a conference. Lindsay holds a secret, one that she is not sure Ty will forgive her for. After he finds out, he wants nothing more than to be with the woman he loves...Can Lindsay trust in Ty? Can Ty convince her he is the one to trust, to be vulnerable with?

I think the reason this camera is so great is because it's a camera that you can't use with a very expensive camera.  For example, if you're looking for a camera that is capable of taking great pictures, you might want to try a camera that is capable of taking great pictures.

Books_5,0,"I've long loved the Sister Arnold series but this one was just too much to stomach. It's preachy, that looooong section on England's foxhunt had zip to do with the story and was a personal argument from the author.  Second, I found myself pitying the one character the reader was meant to hate--- this character was far more interesting than the good guys. As for the good guys they suddenly came off as smug and downright cruel to anyone who wasn't in the circle of Sister's friends. Speaking of Sister, I didn't like what's happened to her character, she's changed. I didn't like this version of her at all--maybe Brown just didn't put enough effort into this novel. The animals were wonderful but there wasn't enough of them. I found myself getting irritated as I read Hounds and the Fury and had to force myself to finish it. Will I buy the next book? Maybe, if I find it used somewhere and even then, only if it's super cheap."

Pet_Supplies_5,0,"My dog has arthritis and Cushing disease, so she takes several medications three times each day.  Pill pocket flavor matters big time here, making the difference between her swallowing meds eagerly versus engaging in repeated  wrestling matches to gag the same pills down her.  My dog occasionally will eat the chicken flavor -- for one pill only.  She spits subsequent doses out right away -- or she picks at the pocket but leaves the pill behind, which puts us back to the wrestling routine.  I have much more consistent success with getting her to swallow meds eagerly if I consistently use the pea/duck flavor Pill Pockets.  Personally, I think those smell like rotten who knows what, but she loves the pea/duck flavor, and that's what matters.  It's a no brainer at my house; I've learned to put the pea/duck version on rotating order and hold my nose."

Toys_and_Games_5,0,"I am not reviewing the game. It's the same Chutes and Ladders it's always been. Rather insipid for anyone over the age of 6, I'd say. No strategy, just counting.

What I will review is the board, graphics, and pieces. This is a 70's retro design. I haven't played the 70's version (or at least haven't in 30 years or more), so I can't comment on the accuracy. I did like the pictures - they show little morality tales. Hard-working children who do nice things are at the bottom of each ladder, and are rewarded at the top for their labors. Lazy or mean kids are at the top of each chute, and get heir comeuppance at the bottom. My son (who is 4) enjoyed looking at each pairing and discussing how and why they succeeded or failed.

That said, the board is rather busy, and it isn't entirely clear to a younger person which square corresponds to which chute or ladder.

The game pieces are sturdy, though the plastic brackets are difficult for little fingers to insert the cardboard children into. The spinner works well once you punch it through. Spinning action is easy and can go for more than a few seconds.

All in all, it's the same boring game it's always been. This retro edition offers some nice additional fun, but is rather busy compared to a more clean modern design."

I've not yet taken the unit out on the road and subjected it to the vibration of highway travel, so the jury is still out on this subject.

Movies_and_TV_5,0,"If I could give this movie a lower rating I'd do it, it deserves more of a 0.16 of a star.  This movie was horrible, not a good ending at all, the casting was fair, but not great.  The graphics were so-so, but not as good as I expected & hoped.  This movie by far (besides Gigli) has to be the biggest disappointment.  I wish it would've flopped in the box office, but like idiots we go see it & leave in shock of the suckiness that took place.  When the movie ended you were like ""that's it, that sucked.""  I don't care if you vote that this review wasn't helpful, you know it was, because deep down inside (if you saw the movie) that it sucked terribly, admit it, & vote that I was helpful...horrible movie, one of the worst..."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"Use With Care! This product worked wonders on the hair algae I couldn't get rid of. I tried everything first. I moved my tank away from sunlight. Changed to a lower light source. Set my lights on a timer. Sprayed things down with 3% hydrogen peroxide. Cleaned hard items in Clorox and then soaked in anti-chlorine water. Boiled my gravel. I mean I tried EVERY THING! I tried AgaeFix, but it caused my harlequin rasbora tetras great distress. I finally purchased this. I cleaned my tank very well with a 75% water change. I did the dosage of 1 drop per gallon. The tetras and Cory catfish took it well. My live plants looked fine. In fact I completed the 3 days of dosage with no trouble. My tank never developed algae after this for a month. The sand, rocks, plants, glass look great! Wow!!! So here is the caution. I believe from what I read that the chemical can lower the oxygen level in the water, the first time cleaning my tank for maintenance, I thought I would do this again-as a preventative. My tetras on the third day are clearly distressed again. From what I read if you see your fish gulping at the top of the water, they may not be getting enough oxygen. Mine were not this time, but I have two very busy air stones and a good filter system in my 20 gal tank. My small goldfish in my five gal did not do so well, and died. I think the were not able to tolerate this stuff. So, this is what I think. If you have tried everything else, try it. Use it when you really need to get the algae under control. If you have not used it before on a particular type of fish, go slow, and maybe try half the dosage. More is not always better."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,"Great product.  I use it to make an aluminum fence around my house that is about 1/4"" thick.  The plastic fence is also designed to be a bit thinner, so that it doesn't look like a stiff piece of metal.  This fence is still very sturdy, but I don't think it will last long.  I'll try to keep it as a regular fence for my kid.  I highly recommend it to anyone who needs an accurate"

Books_5,0,"Magic might not be enough to get Harry Dresden out of trouble in Jim Butcher's Storm Front. Take one private detective, a heavy dose of magic, intriguing murders, and a splash of humor and you have the recipe for this delightful novel. Harry Dresden uses his wizarding skills to solve cases, and his self-deprecating humor, intelligence, and good nature make him a character a reader can relate to. The action moves the book at a good pace, and I found myself smiling and even laughing out loud. I feel like we've scratch the surface of this fantastic world Butcher has created. I'm thrilled to discover we have a lot more books to read in The Dresden Files. Storm Front by Jim Butcher is a must read for those people who enjoy urban fantasy and detective mysteries."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"These are a nice pair of fins for practice in a gym or lap pool. They come with a mesh carrying case, though I usually use an enclosed bag when I take them to the gym so they don't drip all over the floor. They fit true to size- they are just snug enough to stay on my feet without being difficult to put on or take off. I usually put them on my feet when I am already in the pool and have had no problems using one hand to slip them on. They do definitely make a difference in my swimming speed. I am a casual swimmer and swim mostly for exercise at the gym. These have increased my lap time pretty significantly and allow me to swim faster without getting so worn out."
Kindle_Store_5,0,"Writing about the effects of the curse of the Scottish play in Stratford upon Avondale, Monica Knightly manages to make murder fun. Or at least solving it. A fast pace, strong protagonist and a slew (yes, slew) of friends and coconspirators combine with intelligent but not boring language make for a great weekend or vacation read."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"This bag is everything I need for my bug out bag. The first thing I noticed was the amount of space it had inside. I was able to fit an 8x10 rolled up tarp, mini sleeping bag, hammock, amongst all my other backpacking needs with plenty of room to spare. It appears to be waterproof/resistant but I haven't tested it yet. The 3 compartments are very useful for items quickly needed such as flashlights first aid kits etc. I did have to adjust the belt/chest straps a little but afterwards it fit perfectly. I've read reviews stating that it only fits larger people which is not true. My waist is 32"" and it fits perfect. Only minor thing was the drawstring which was a quick fix. Simply replace it with paracord and you're gtg."

Kindle_Store_5,0,"I read about a chapter of this book. The writing is irritating, being 99% heroine's inner dialogue, with tiny phrases of conversation every page or so. The action freezes solid while we examine the heroine's inner thoughts, her past, her toenail polish ...

Forcing myself onward, I discovered this chick is truly too stupid to be out on her own. She let her former boyfriend walk all over her, steal her blind and humiliate her on national tv. This doesn't fit what I've heard of successful ballerinas, who have to be intelligent and tough as steel to make it to the top of their profession. It also does not give me a heroine I can relate to. Now she's chasing after a cage fighter ... and is so TSTL she leaves her expensive coat with cell phone and wallet in a cheap dive bar while she pirouettes off to chase the hero.

I suggest the hero run the other way as fast as his muscular legs can carry him."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,"Love my new mat!!! The material is strong and the instructions are clear. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the mat is a bit small, but it's a very large mat. It is still very comfortable to sit on. I wish it was a bit thicker. The material is a bit soft for a mat and it's not as thick as I thought it would be. I would definitely buy another one."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"I don't like to wear pantyhose because I don't like the compression around my midsection.  However, I had a wedding to go to and it was cool enough that I didn't want bare legs.  I had a long skirt, but I wanted stockings longer than knee-highs just to be on the safe side.  So I figured I would try these.

These fit me pretty well.  I am right in that height/weight combination where I can wear either A or B sized pantyhose, and I'm a size 8 or medium in most US-sized pants and skirts.  They had a slight reinforced toe, which I appreciate, as I tend to get runs in pantyhose/stockings/etc.

These had no holes or runs in them and I did not damage them when I put them on.  This is a big plus since I tend to ruin a lot of garments of this type.  These seemed particularly sturdy to me.  They stayed up.  The silicone part is inside the lace at the top and it is clear so it will not show, even if you intend for the tops of these to show (I'm hiding mine well under my skirt, but the option is there for you if you want it).

There were a few loose threads at the top but they weren't terribly noticeable.  In the end, because these fit and seemed really sturdy, I'm quite happy with them.  You can be practical with them if you want, too, if your skirt is long enough, or you can show off the tops for a different look.

Product provided by the seller for evaluation purposes."
Toys_and_Games_5,1,My kids loved playing with this set and the materials are good. My son loves to throw the pieces together and the pieces are sturdy. The box itself is sturdy and it's nice to have a little piece of paper in it. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys crafts and a bit of imagination. I also love the fact that it is a magnetic ball joint.

It's a perfect treat for my dogs. I purchased this for my dog and it's great for him to keep his teeth clean. It is a little heavier than I expected, but it works well. I'm not sure it will last long, but I don't have to worry about it going out."

Toys_and_Games_5,0,"This little tea set just makes no sense to me.  The tea pot doesn't actually open, so you can't actually pour water into it.  Ok, fine.  It does make a cool pouring sound, but only randomly.  Most of the time it just bursts into song when tipped, and then makes the pouring sound when you bump it with your elbow or something.  It would have been awesome to have the option of turning the music off and just having the pouring sound to play ""tea"" with.  The songs are just strange and annoying anyways.  The cups too, while cute, have two holes drilled on one side.  So, heaven forbid your child actually pour liquid in, if they happen to try to drink from that side the liquid will just pour out of the side of the cup onto their lap before it even reaches their mouth.  The cake stacker thingy is actually pretty cute and fun.  And, my kids love this little set and mix it in with their other kitchen toys.  It was a gift, so we will keep it, but I would not have purchased this for them on my own.  I feel like the makers of this set assume that kids need constant electronic stimulation to keep them entertained, but I think the opposite is actually true. I think a plain, non-verbal, no batteries required set is so much better to encourage open-ended play."

Kindle_Store_5,0,I felt this was a well written story with good grammar and structure. Riley started out as a typical woman who worried too much about what others would think. As the story progresses you see her coming into her own. Jensen was as a typical bad boy in the military. For a short story the author did great giving both characters a nice back story.
Books_5,0,"This a brilliant, fun, thought provoking, wonderful book by a mistress of her craft.  I do not know if it is the best detective novel of all time, but it is up there. I would say it was one of the best novels I ever read - period. I read it many years ago, decades, in fact. I could do no more than give a general synopsis, though usually I don't bother when others have anyway. But, if you put a copy in my hand today, I would read it again. The fact that she was not aware of certain evidence or relied on evidence that we would now perhaps think not so persuasive is irrelevant. Most detective novels are far more unrealistic than this one, which is at least steeped in history. I read some of the negative comments, as I almost always do when I loved a book. Generally speaking, it gives the impression that some people who are uninterested or uninformed by history were bored by the book. But, note that over 80% of reviewers gave it 4 or more stars and over 90% 3 or more. That's pretty good. This is not a Reacher novel (and I like them) and the protagonist is bedridden, so don't expect action. It is a mental adventure and she succeeded wildly."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,"A while back I bought this set and thought it would be a nice addition to the tool box.

It's stuck on one noise so anytime we turn it on, it makes the same sound over and over again. We haven't dropped it or done anything to it (even though I would expect a baby toy to be able to withstand drops). My toddler is sad that we won't let him play with it, but I've tried everything to make it work again and it won't. It has a lot of potential and some cool features, but if those features don't work, there's no point in having it. As far as I'm concerned it was a waste of money."

I recommend it to anyone with a passion for movies.  It's a great DVD for anyone who likes to see great action movies.I was happy to get this film and a good price for it.  I had to wait a little bit for the movie to get on Blu-ray.  I'm glad it's finally available on Blu-ray.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"For once its nice to have a hot breakfast at work.

I almost never have time to make breakfast in the mornings so I usually take a granola bar or a piece of fruit. Now that I have this neat little set of Crackin' Egg cookers I can enjoy a hot meal at my desk and it takes less than thirty seconds. Its super easy to use. Just make sure to poke the yolk with a fork so it doesn't explode in the container. I also found that if you spray the container with a little non-stick cooking spray that the egg comes out cleaner.

The only gripe I have with these microwave egg cookers is that I haven't been able to make an egg that isn't over hard. I've tried cooking it at thirty seconds instead of the recommended thirty to fourt-five. But it still comes out over cooked. I think I'll be trying the scrambled egg recipe but other than that I still enjoy a hot and nutritious breakfast. I'm thinking this would be great for someone with kids because you could pop it in the microwave in the morning and take it with you in the car. They're very portable.

Overall I think these are a cool way to make a super fast breakfast that is nutritious as well as delicious.

Books_5,0,"I don't intend to minimize the seriousness of the subject, but I have read many books with similar stories.  So, the story was predictable to me personally, but I really enjoyed her writing that is poetic without being too decorative, and definitely philosophical, particularly the main character's inner dialogues are precious and deeply moving. ""Since he is innocent of any crime they may be charging him with, he could repent only for the act of living."" is one example.  The author did a good job, not vilifying any characters, but presents them as human beings in situations. I would give three and a half stars."

Toys_and_Games_5,0,"After reading some other reviews I was concerned about the quality and sizing of these Creature Power suits, but I have been really happy with both.  Of course the kids (huge Wild Kratts fans!) love them!  They are played with regularly and have held up well.  The 4-6 fits my average size five year old and my petite eight year old. The 6-8 fits my average size ten year old. I would recommend these if you have a Wild Kratt fan in your home!"

The book is written as if it were a biography, but it is a detailed account of the life of a young man. This is a very good book.I was looking forward to reading the book, but had to wait a bit for the ending. I liked the ending, but I did not like the way it was written.This is a great book for any college student. The author provides insight into the lives of many people, and makes them"
Kindle_Store_5,0,"Loved this one. Quite short  (I read in an evening) but charming, as always, with Falconer and Carmichael and the usual suspects. But the great thing about this one is the sly ending. I very much enjoyed the whole story but the joy I felt reading the last three pages was terrific. Highly recommend for a light, fun, quick read."
Electronics_5,0,"I have an Iphone 5 and this holder is fantastic. It fits my phone perfectly and very snug with no wobbling or movement at all. Maybe I am an odd duck, but i wear this on my forearm facing the inside. I like the access to my phone it provides without having to twist and squirm to get it off my bicep when I am running (skipping songs, etc). The sizing seems correct. My forearm is 12"" around and it fits snug but is not constricting. It seems to be very well made with good stitching and a nice, comfortable padding on the back. The fabric wicks moisture as it is supposed to and is very cool feeling. When I am traveling and running, I just slide my room key in there too. It is perfect as far as I am concerned and had exceeded my expectations."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"5'6"" and 125. I have literally tried on about 30 pairs of jeans this year. Gap, Lucky Brand,Express,Saks, Macy's,seriously if they are known for their jeans have been there. Who is shaped that way.? A mid-rise jean is not 10 inches from your crotch to your waist? Legs so tight they all wound up inside out , crotch up on the dressing room floor! Sorry to the help but when the leg openings are so tight I am wrestling them off they can untangle the wretched things. The mid-rises hit half way up my back! I am 65 years old so white jeans are very tricky. These are perfect. I hate paying this much for a single pair of jeans but I am NOT sending these back as I expected to.. Good weight and still not see through? I thought they were going to be lightweight and they are but not too thin/thick. The rise is a perfect 8 inches/zipper 4 inches and the leg openings allow someone with a calf muscle to move  and they don't ride up. I've had them on about 3 hours now and yeah they stretch out a little but in a good way. I can sit cross legged on my bed w/o discomfort! But these jeans! I don't care what color just get a pair before these sell out. I may buy another color myself. I tried to get a shot of my ass in but it wouldn't download! If these make a 65 yr old old lady look good- you'll rock them!"

Electronics_5,1,So far I've tried networked with the internet and it works fine. The only downside is that it's very small. I bought the TRS-80A as a replacement for my older model. I'm very pleased. I bought this to replace a broken one I bought for my TV. I wanted something that had a built-in DVD player and could use a USB hub. I chose the TRS-80A because it's very portable. I have a Roku player and the TRS-80A is just about perfect. I'm sure it will last a long time. The cord is long enough for me to get on the couch and use it while playing games. I can also use the remote to turn the TV on and off with my Roku. It's not the best for long distance but I'm sure it will last a long time. I would highly recommend this product. My wife loves this mouse. She loves that it is small. She has her own usb mouse and it's so small that she can move it around without touching the mouse. It's easy to set up and she loves it. It's not bulky. It's very comfortable. The only negative is that it takes a little getting used to it.

Pet_Supplies_5,0,"The prduct description for these toys says they are ""ecologically responsible"".  I personally don't think killing animals for leather is an ecologically responsible action.  If you love your pets enough to buy them lots of nice toys, then you're an animal lover like myself.  If you love animals as much as I do, then you're probably a vegetarian and don't use animal products like leather.  When I purchased these cat toys I was not aware that they were made with leather because the product description omits this detail.  As soon as I opened the box from Amazon and saw the genuine leather fish heads I was absolutely furious!  Why on earth would I want one animal to suffer - a cow used for its hide - so that I can provide a play toy for another animal - my cat?  I would never kill a cat to use its hide to make a toy for a cow!!

I did end up keeping the toys because I didn't want to deal with returning them - which would also be ecologically irresponsible with the resources going in to the shipping process.  Also, one of my cats absolutely loves feather toys which was the main reason I purchased these in the first place, so I gave him the fishies and he loves them.  They aren't the most popular toys in the kitty basket, but they haven't gone unused.  If my cats are really hyper and I toss the fishies in the air for them they will go after them, but if the toys are just laying there the cats don't go up to them and start playing with them.

I would not recommend these toys to a friend and I would not purchase them again.  If, however, the materials were changed to a faux leather or other man-made material, I would be happy to give a better review/rating."

Books_5,0,"Two Heart. One Hope. This series is so great! Melanie Dickerson's Fairy tale retelling stories mix romance, history, and adventure together. The first book is The Healer's Apprentice. The adaption of Sleeping Beauty. Rose has been appointed as a healers apprentice at Hagenheim Castle. A rare opportunity for a wood-cutters daughter like her. While she often feels uneasy at the sight of blood. Rose is determined to prove herself capable. Future will mean returning home to marry the aging bachelor her mother has chosen for her  a bloated, disgusting merchant who make Rose feel ill. When Lord Hamlin, the future duck, is injured, it is Rose who must tend to him. As she works to heal his wound, she begins to understand emotions shes never felt before and wonders if he feel the same. But falling in love is forbidden, as Lord Hamlin is betrothed to a mysterious young woman in hiding. As Roses life spins toward confusion. She must take the first steps in a journey to discover her own destiny. Although Rose is not as courage as the other books heroines, shes more a bit old fashion compare to other characters in other book(perhapsI guess only a little) Bur she has her advantages, shes kind, she try her best to help her friends, and full of responsibility. She knew she cant be with Lord Hamlin because of the betrothed, so she decided to sacrificed her own happiness rather the good of Hagenheim. Besides all of that, shes a story teller!! How interesting! So for those who concern the shallow characters, I think its better to consider this book as a beautiful fairy tale rather than a contemporary novel. (the book itself is based on the Medieval term, sojust think read the book as Romeo and Juliet, but with happy ending. )  Forget the plot about a damsel in distress, youll find yourselves enjoyed a gorgeous romance story.

Since the drive has no direct contact with the case, and there is no fan, I would be reluctant to use it for a hot running drive.

I wish I had the opportunity to see it with my friends. I wish they had this on DVD. It is not a bad movie, I would recommend it to anyone. I bought it because of the fact that it was one of the best movies ever made. I don't know if I should have paid more, but it is a great movie.I have not seen this movie for many years.  I have seen it several times.  I have seen it again and again.  I will be buying it.  I will be buying it as a gift to my husband.  Thank you for making this movie."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"I had a Tekton mini bolt cutter, but this is much better.  The HK Porter has a maximum opening of nearly 1/2"" (7/16ths of an inch at the very top of the V opening) which means it opens more than twice as wide as the Tekton.  There is enough strength to cut through framing nails (.131"" or thereabouts) with little difficulty; wood screws cut like butter.  Also, while the Tekton has a flip-up wire catch at the bottom to hold the tool closed, the HKP has a slightly clumsy but perfectly effective thumb catch at the top, just below the cutter head - it works from either side, making the tool left- as well as right-handed.

The tool has a very comfortable soft plastic grip.  It feels solid and works effectively.  It does lack the Tekton's limiter screw.  It would not cut the only bolt I tried it on (neither does the Tekton), but scored it enough to guide an oscillating blade."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"I am so pleased with the ODOR Absorbed Activated Charcoal NATURAL Deodorizer Bag by UBERPAKK. In the past the only option I thought I had was placing one of those charcoal tubs in my bathroom or closet which works pretty well but doesn't look nice at all. This will eliminate the odors and yet be non-imposing on my decor or be forgotten in my closet.

I put one of these right smack dab on the top of the tank of my toilet of my guest bathroom which is only used when we have guests. It goes great in there and also looks very decorative. (So much better than having the charcoal tub sitting on the floor). I put the other one in a guest room closet. I really hate going in one of my rooms, opening up a closet and it smelling musty. Now, it never will. I hung it on a hanger and it can be seen by anyone who hangs their clothes in there. It just looks nice. The muted green goes with any room in my house so I am certain that I will be ordering more before too long.

I was fortunate to receive this product at a discount in exchange for my HONEST & UNBIASED opinion. I ALWAYS pretest every product prior to writing a review. I am free to write whatever I believe to be true, whether positive or negative. This is my true story and my honest opinion."

  A bright level, 80 lumens which lasts for 55minutes.

The choice is between extreme battery life vs. useful illumination.  Single, low level illumination which lasts for 100 hours doesn't seem as useful to me as workable illumination."
Books_5,0,"As an avid reader I have been pretty disappointed lately by the newer books and how boring they are or how bad the ending is. This book did not disappoint. I am giving this book 5 stars, the characters were very developed and I felt like I could easily visualize them and they weren't unrealistic. The story itself is good with lots of turns and I was left guessing MANY times. This was not a predictable mystery which I really liked and which made me keep wanting to read to know what happened. I felt it did have a couple dry parts or parts that SEEMED repetitive, but those parts were quickly redeemed. I would highly recommend this book."

Pet_Supplies_5,0,"I have two cats - one who was OBSESSED with these treats and another who turned his nose up at these.  My cat who ate these was a consistent vomiter, and I always assumed it was hairball related.  However,  I started to notice that after she ate these treats, she seemed to throw up more.... I researched online and found 100s of people who reported that these treats made their cats ill to the point of death in some cases.  I immediately threw my treats away and alerted all the cat parents I knew of the potential risk.  I couldn't imagine losing my fur child to something so senseless!

After tossing these, my cat has had no vomiting incidents and has done just find without treats.  My cat who never liked these has never had any issues getting sick, which leads me to believe that these were negatively affecting the health of my cat.  We've kept their food the same otherwise, so this was the only variable that has changed.  If you must give these to your cat, please proceed with caution and keep an eye on their health."

She captured the Old West with a descriptive and believable setting. Rena dresses as a boy and helps her brother, who is falsely convicted of murder, escape the gallows. Now she has the bounty hunter on her tail!

I felt connected to the spunky heroine and the hero who is surprisingly a bounty hunter. While this was a clean romance I did feel the sparks building at the end of the story and had wished it was a bit longer to show more of the budding romance."

Electronics_5,0,"but, then, I realized that it has no memory expandability, a small screen, and a non-replaceable battery. I wondered why. Then, I happened upon the Aiptek A-HD+ 1080P which had all those features and more. It weighs a tiny bit more, but gives much more bang for the buck. A little bit cheaper too. Not as sexy though. Anyway, I bought the Aiptek and that's that. It's well worth considering. Just a tip, IMHO.

Update to post 7/7/08: I was rightfully admonished about giving the Mino a rating without having used it. thank you for the feedback. I need to qualify my statements above by saying that my 3 star rating was based only on the Mino's features vs. its inherent limitations. That is the only basis for my rating. For what it's worth by the way, the Aiptek is great and running 720p at 60 fps. It could run at 1080p, but I haven't tried it yet. It's a very nice camera with a very good picture.

Books_5,0,"In CARNAL INNOCENCE author Nora Roberts has created a mesmerizing tale of madness, murder, and love in a small southern town of the bayou.  Put into play is Caroline Waverly, a beautiful world renowned concert violinist who is still fragile from both a public breakup and private breakdown after witnessing her lover with another.  Caroline, has left the concert circuit escaping to her late grandmothers home in Innocence, Mississippi.  However instead of the peace and tranquility she expected, she found a town reeling from two vicious and heinous murders. And, if that weren't enough Caroline discovers a third victim on her property.

Enter Carolines devastatingly handsome bad-boy neighbor - Tucker Longstreet.  Big, beautiful with a devilish grin and the sexiest southern drawl ever.  But for some reason, Tucker makes Caroline feel safe even though his reputation for breaking hearts has put him at the top of the suspect list, seeing as how he was connected to each of the murdered women.

***  Lordy, lordy, but I have listened to Tom Stechschulte before and I have to say that NO ONE does sexy Southern drawls like Mr. Stechschulte!  He is a master of making a written hero pop to life as one very SEXY heart throb - just by hearing that rich southern interpretation.  Wow!  And let me also say that the sensuality both actual and implied was steaming all the way through to the very end!

Now mix that with exquisite storytelling by Nora Roberts and you have a perfect combination that will force you to keep listening way into the middle of the night and then turning it back on as soon as you wake up!  Be it children, heroes or heroines, pets, even nasty villains  - Ms. Roberts writes the books that grab you and simply won't let you go.  Loved every minute of this audiobook, the outstanding performance of Mr. Stechschulte and the entire cast of characters who made this very hard to put down  and immensely satisfying book!

Pet_Supplies_5,0,"**UPDATED AT THE END**

When we got our new dog, my wife and I decided that we were only going to go with good products that didn't contain any harsh chemicals! After searching around a little, we decided on Cain & Able because I love the smell of Peppermint and Tea Trea is a wondrous plant!

GENERAL
First off, this shampoo smells great out of the bottle! It's not too strong after our puppy is dry, but it really does leave a very nice smell on her. I can't say that the pump is as bad as some people have mentioned, but then again we only have a 21lb dog so we don't have to use all that much on her!

EFFECTIVENESS
We have noticed less itching from our dog, something that has nothing to do with fleas, but according to our vet probably something to do with her diet before we got her (she was a street rescue). She doesn't seem to desire to lick it once she has been washed, but even if she did we feel a lot better knowing that there are no artificial perfumes and chemicals that might be bad for her! We can't comment on the effectiveness of being an insect repellent, but both of the main ingredients are known to be natural repellents and we feel safe knowing she is protected!

WHY 5 STARS??
- Great value for a safe and earth-friendly product
- Smells GREAT!
- Contains no harmful chemicals!

OVERALL
Overall we are very happy with this purchase, and our puppy seems to love it! I highly recommend this product, especially if you care about what seeps into your dog's skin!

**UPDATE 03/2012**
We have been using this shampoo exclusively for over 5 months now, and we are still VERY happy with it! Our dog doesn't itch at all any more and her coat is shiny (a good diet greatly helps this)! We will continue buying this product unless we happen upon anything better!"

UltraHD Lighted Work Center: Easy to put together and very sturdy, LED work light and adjustable leveling feet. GREAT BENCH. And this is what I expect from Seville Classics. I also own 6 of their Industrial Wire Shelving Units and they are excellent too. It is what you would expect from a quality piece.

UltraHD Cushioned Pneumatic Work Stool: Very easy to put together and adjusts to the correct height for the bench. Do not overly care for the small back rest but it it ok. One small issue, it only has 4 wheels, they really should have had a 5th wheel, as it has already slipped out from under me once already. Be careful not to sit on the edge too quickly

Optional 3"" Wheels for UltraHD Work Center: Bad purchase. It not only raises the bench 4 inches, you are now sitting 4 inches lower on the bench. I am 5' 10"" and I had a hard time sitting above the table to work on items. I would save the hassle and $34 on these."

Toys_and_Games_5,0,This was a hit with my 4 year old granddaughter.
Movies_and_TV_5,0,"Positives:
Great acting performances by Pippi and her penguins. Mostly good by everyone else except Carrey and Lansbury, at times, reverted to their stereotypic past learned phrasings and characterizations.
Enough uniquely humorous lines and skits to make the movie a mostly novel laughable experience. So, kudos to the writers for those parts.

Negatives:
Studios with their crew of writers, directors and producers know that making money takes precedence over creativity so with that thought in mind we have the following too predictable scenes:
A stereotypic plot framework of a newly divorced couple with teens.
Teens have their own issues as well as navigating/mediating the divorce.
Dad, as usual, had his own father family issues growing up.
Dad is seen as more in love with his monied vocational interests than the kids.
Mom, has a new male friend that ends up to be a boor. Yes, gets booted.
At stake is a prize piece of property that is predictably going to be procured by Dad after he re-prioritizes with the help of, guess who, penguins.
Dad also wins kids and wife after he re-prioritizes with the help of, guess who, penguins.
Penguins, at first, were presented in a clever way but towards the end the writers ran out of ideas and the animals just did the same made-up cute tricks found in most animal movies.

In summary, if the movie just had Pipi and the penguins to build around it would have had the potential to be creatively - spot on."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Another reviewer wrote about this and I missed it, so here it is again:  If the power is turned off to this unit, it trips.  The other reviewer points out the best or worst case example:  If you plug aquarium equipment into this, and the power goes out, even for a blink, you must press the reset button to restore power to the equipment.  A lamp would be another bad thing to plug into this, since you would have to find and press the reset button to turn the lamp back on.  An alarm clock would be a bad idea for obvious reasons.

If you can live with this constraint (I could), then the good news is that it seems to work in all other respects."

I was given an ARC in exchange for an honest review.I was looking forward to reading the book, but the last part was so repetitive that I could not get into the book. I am glad I did.

The story itself was not very interesting, but I felt it needed a little more development. I am not a huge fan of the hero and heroine, but the book is mostly about the next chapter in the series. It is a fun little mystery that will keep you wanting to read more of the story.

I would recommend this book.I have read many of the author's books and I have never found myself wanting to give up on them. I found myself wanting more of the characters and their story. I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to all.The story was great. "

The pictures are very sharp and close cropping is not a problem. And I like the red color."
Toys_and_Games_5,0,"This toy is amazing - and is in no way for kids only!  It was intended for my youngest nephew who does in fact adore it and carries it around with him, but his older brothers who are both teenagers also couldn't stop for lack of a better word ""playing"" with it.  In fact, he had to fight them off for playing rights!  When I first received it, I unboxed it to make sure everything was alright and you do need to put on the sticker decals according to the diagram on the box, and I've got to say that even for me as an adult seeing what it all does so I could explain it to him was actually quite fun for me too.

The Millennium Falcon itself is much larger than I imagined, making it even cooler for kids, and it's fantastic that they also included a Hans, Chewie, and R2D2 figure rather than making you buy all the people separately (though there is plenty of room for extra figures from the movie to buy on your own for even more fun).  There's so much you can do inside the Millennium Falcon too.  There are trap doors, a Jedi training station, a movable ladder, seats for your figures, blasting rockets, and a cockpit you can open and close.  For the adults and teens it was just a tad disappointing that the cockpit only sits one so Hans and Chewbacca can't both sit in there together like in the movies, but the youngest didn't seem to mind at all.

This really is so much fun for the young and young at heart.  If you were a huge Star Wars fan back in the day this is a must to get for your kids - and that way you can play with it too!"

Also, if you are larger up top, definitely go for the bigger size. The material is stretchy which is the only reason the dress fit. It is very nicely made material and look wise.

Movies_and_TV_5,0,"From the beginning episode of season 1, I was hooked on this show.  It's a nuanced series of tightly plotted stories with a running series of subplots that slowly build from the beginnning.  The individual stories are not always what they seem - from the outset, the viewer knows that not all the people Reese and Finch try to help are victims - quite often, they are the perps that Reese has to stop before they commit whatever crime they have planned.

Of course, there are some clunkers but even the bad shows are superior to a lot of the dreck currently being aired on TV - broadcast or cable.

Before the show premiered, Jonathan Nolan, the series creator, called it Batman without the cape.  And, like all good hero/anti-hero franchises, this show has its own support 'family' as well as a marvelous rogues gallery with some enemies fixed seemingly permantently in the mythos and others appearing and eventually being handled.  Some, such as Elias, a mob boss out to control the NY rackets, start to slip into the show with mentions episodes before the character appears.

Many of these allies and rogues carry on into the new season which successfully opened with the resolution to the season 1 cliffhanger.  The flashbacks continue to reveal the backgrouds and motivations of Reese and Finch as well as the supporting cast - good guy or bad guy.  Fortunately, unlike producer JJ Abram's earlier success ""Lost"", this are much more defined & explain more - propelling the episode along.  (I love ""Lost"" but the flashbacks and flashforwards did get a bit confusing.)

I watched season 1 again then season 2 before season 3 premiered (several mini-marathons involved).  Each time I watch it, I see or hear something I missed before that enhances the show.  Some even have significance as the series goes on.

This is one of the very few Must-See shows for me.  And the only one on one of the big 4 networks.

And I'm already planning to buy season 3."

Ishmael takes angry exception to that injustice, and things unravel in blood fashion from there. The vivid gritty descriptions add to the novella's considerable appeal."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"My grandpa got me (and the rest of the grandkids) an economy version one of these on his last trip to Switzerland in the 80s. I still have it.

The one here is different in that the shield is embedded instead of stamped, and it also has a key/lanyard ring. The distinguishing features of this model are as such:

- There are no tools on the back of the knife. While this may be viewed as a negative by some, it gives the advantage that the backsprings are smooth and flush with the back of the knife, and it is therefore more comfortable in the hand, especially during extended use.

- It is the 3-1/4"" size. (closed) This fits better in the hip pocket than the much more numerous 3-1/2"" models. One can barely feel that it is there. If you like the smaller size, but want back tools, the Sportsman adds a corkscrew and reamer to the back, and drops the small blade in favor of a nail file. The Small Tinker (not available here at this time, despite the specs published here) adds a phillips and reamer to the back.

I bought this knife as a whittler. I figured the smooth back would make it more comfortable in the hand, and I was right. One does need to remove the keyring and grind off the nub, though, for true comfort. I also got a little too creative trying to turn the can opener into a specialized carving tool. When I ground off the hook at the base of the tool, that messed up the stop, and now it closed all the way into the handle. It takes an act of God to get it out now, so I kind of ruined the knife. Oh well, it is still good for whittling!

In stock form, the flat screwdriver tip on the bottle opener works well, and the small tip on the can opener works in a #2 phillips most times. Just take care that it doesn't close on your hand."

Kindle_Store_5,0,"The Silver magic series is perhaps my favorite by this author. And this second book is the natural follow-up to the first. Everyone's favorite Dees from the first book, Glass, here has her chance to try life as a human. And she quickly lands herself in a heap of trouble, along with a romantic intrigue.

This book features the same imaginative inventiveness as the first book, and the same colorful characters. The Dees are wonderful as always. But the author's most brilliant characters, in my mind, are the Brothers Grimm. metaphysical hit men who live by their own convoluted code. This pair is calling for their own book. But let's get back to the book at hand, which is grand enough in it's own right.

I don't want to reveal too much, but if you thought the Dees were magnificent in defense of the Howard mansion, just wait until you see them turned loose in this book."

Books_5,1,"I have serious doubts concerning this book, as it is a history book that is about the life and times of the West Indies. There is no mention of the colonial wars, and yet it is a history book that is written in the context of the early days of the colonial war. The book is very interesting, and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the history of the West Indies. I do think that the author should have included some very interesting facts about the West Indies, but I would not recommend this book to anyone who is not interested in the history of the West Indies. I have read some of the reviews of this book, and I do not think that this book was a good read. It is not a history book, it is a history of the West Indies, but it is a history of the times."

The build quality is good, but it is made entirely of lightweight plastic.  It is mostly correct, except the poseable arms are a little off. They do not retract inside the robot and instead stick out. It's not a big deal. The robot is about 10"" tall, but you can raise the head to make it about 11"".

The robot includes 3 cheap AAA trial batteries. I immediately replaced them with Alkalines. They are accessed from the bottom of the robot, and a screwdriver is required.  The power switch is also on the bottom. Options are: Off, Play, and Trial. Dialogue is triggered by pushing the robot's power pack on the side. Push it once, and it says one the robot's popular phrases. Hold the button for a few seconds, and it will go thru all the robot's dialogue. If I counted correctly, there are 15 phrases.  The LED lights look very cool.

All around, I like this little robot. Is it a little overpriced?  Perhaps. It still looks cool on my desk though."

I used this to light my car and it worked great.I use this as a hiking lantern. The light is bright enough to see through the rain and it is very easy to turn on and off. I will say that I have to use a little bit of torque to turn it off when I go hiking. I have to get it on the ground.

I've been using this case for about a year now, and it's been very well made. The case is a bit too big for my hand and I'm getting a little sore with the fingers. I will probably just get a new one, as it is nice to be able to hold it for longer than it is in my hand. The only thing I really like is that it has a small pocket on the back, and that it is really easy to find it when not in use. I think I'll just buy another one. I don't know if I'll be able to find it again, but for the price, I'll definitely give it a shot.I bought this in the past and love it.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"UPDATE#2 The tape that is used is not what I'm used to calling VHB. Dropped my hard hat last night and two holders popped off. Do not recommend.  UPDATE: After using these for a few nights, I discovered that two of them had moved on the hard hat. I don't know if it was the freezing temps outside, or the hot temps sitting on the dash in the truck. Whatever the reason, I had to replace the tape on one of them. The tape they use it not the same VHB tape that I have. And I have 3M VHB, right out of the box, that I have used for years, so I know mine is legit.) These are not good for hard hat use. Two Cons...The holders are flat. There really is no flat spot on a hard hat, so there will be a small space along the edge that will not adhere to the surface. Its why Go Pro makes curved helmet mounts. Its a big deal, because enough of the VHB tape does make contact. Also, the holders are two different sizes. There is no instruction as to which goes where. I placed the large ones toward the back of the hard hat, and I hope that is correct."

Books_5,0,"I had absolutely no idea that this book was in verse until I read a review for it a week or two ago, and by that time I had already requested it from the library. I'm glad I didn't know, because I might not have read it. This was my first experience with verse and not something I would have willingly chosen. At first it was a little hard to follow the broken sentences, but when I got used to it I found it so incredibly addictive!

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"I'm a plus size woman (24/26 in pants, 3X in shirts), but only C cup breasts. It's hard to find lingerie that fits the way I want. I'm not one of those comfortable big girls that likes flaunting it or wearing lots of tight things so I definitely wanted something loose. I spent 4 hours browsing multiple sites for plus size lingerie and read every review I could find. I ended up buying this in a 5X because the reviews were mostly consistent with buying 2 sizes up. I was worried it would be too loose on my breasts because of that, but it's not bad. It is a complete halter, so if you want your back covered at all, this isn't for you, but it does fit well if you go 2 sizes up, at least in my case, and the breast coverage seems nearly universal. Theres a lot of material to cover more, but it's tight enough to not be useless on smaller cup sizes. It's obviously not great material, but for this price, you shouldn't expect too much. I would recommend it overall."

I have had it for about a year now and I am very pleased with it.

The only negative I have is the power switch.  I have to charge it every day, so I would prefer to have a power switch, but it is a pain in the butt to turn it on.  It does not seem to work well with my gb12x2.  I would recommend it for those who use their gb12x2 and want to use it with their laptop.I've had a few of these for a few months now, and haven't had any problems.

The only negative is the soles are a little tighter than I expected. It's a little hard to get them on with socks. The shoe is a bit too tight for me to wear them with socks. If I had to go up a size I would probably order a half size up. However, I think I would prefer a half size up since I don't have a lot of room to wear them with socks. I'm sure I could have gotten a size up if I wanted to. I'm not a big fan of the color and the soles are a little too tight for me. I've had a few pairs of this brand before, but I have no regrets. They are very well made and they're very well made. I would highly recommend this brand. My daughter loves these shoes. She loves them."

Every family dinner or get together that calls for mashed potatoes, there's no discussion on whose making it- everyone knows it's me. I'll take the title as the mashed potato master.

I have gone through endless amounts of potato mashers and have had handles fall off on me a few times. I just hated the design on them as I would get faitued easily. It's a workout- you'll definitely break a sweat mashing potatoes for 20 people!

When I saw this masher and the handle design I had to have it. Upon opening the package, I was so excited when I picked it up and felt how comfortable it was in my hand, and most importantly how strong and sturdy it was. There is no flimsiness to it what so ever.

I put it to the test with loaded mashed potatoes (sour cream, chives, bacon, cheddar cheese, the works). You can apply much more pressure with little effort and mash more effectively without tiring yourself out. The consistency also turned out better. This is exactly what I needed! I will use this masher so often and I have no concerns of it failing on me. My family members all want one now too. Thank you for making my job easier eternal chef! I have not yet used the peelers (I have my ""go to"" potato peeler I will not cheat on). This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."
Kindle_Store_5,0,"Why I Picked It Up
By now you can deduce that I am interested in any book that involves musicians. So of course I had to pick this one up, especially considering the fact that it hinted at a best friends romance.

Plot

It was that and more. The story of Chloe and Noah was complicated to say the least and it hooked me in. Seeing their struggles, seeing the two of them fighting their attraction, and trying to live life in the spotlight kept me engaged from the very beginning.

Leading Lady

Chloe was a great character. She cared for Noah. She was excited to get a new start. She was happy and determined. On the other hand, she had a backbone and didn't take crap from anyone, especially her ex or Noah's ex.

Leading Male

Noah was sweet, talented, and humble which you don't find in many of the musician characters in novels nowadays. I absolutely fell in love with him and his charms.

Romance

I liked the way that Wicks evolved this plot. I loved seeing a bit of the back-story of the two characters, both individually and together. It really gave their relationship depth. Their relationship was fun with, of course, some drama. I loved the tension between the two of them for the first half of the novel. I enjoyed how their relationship grew more and more. And of course, I adored the fact that they were friends first and foremost. They were perfect for each other and complimented each other very well. I hope we see some of them in the companion novel.

Conclusion

Overall, Before He Was Famous was a great book about friends to lovers with a dash of famous musician: the perfect recipe for a great book."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"It's funny how one goes through life without having an item that when you finally get it, you wonder how in the world you lived without it! Well, that's how it is with a block plane. Being somewhat of a power tool snob, I normally don't turn to hand tools when working a project. I saw a relevant YouTube video extolling the virtues of hand planes and noticed that the master woodworker's wall was filled with planes of all sizes and shapes. It got me to wondering what I was missing. I already had a #4 plane squirreled away in my work bench, but this master craftsman convinced me that I needed a block plane. So I got this one.
Once it arrived, I did the standard ""tune up"" by getting the packing coatings removed, adjusting the blade, and sort of checking the flatness of the shoe. All was well.
I had a project going at the time with several half-lap joints where the ends extended a little proud beyond the edge. End grain! Yikes! That's not going to machine well. And I want to use a 1/4"" round over bit with my router, but before I can do that, I need to take that end grain protrusion down to flush with the other surface. Block plane to the rescue! A few quick swipes with a very light cut and it looked perfect with no breakout on the grain. I am a happy camper. I also picked up a stone and honing guide, since now I'll be using my planes a lot more. Next step is to get a few diamond honing stones in finer grits and get really serious about having insanely sharp tools."

Kindle_Store_5,0,"George Wier's ""Longnecks & Twisted Hearts"" is the third in the series of The Bill Travis Mysteries and the follow-up to ""The Last Call"" and ""Capitol Offense"". In ""Longnecks & Twisted Hearts"" Bill finds himself going back home, to his childhood hometown, to bury his once best friend. Upon reaching town limits he is met by a police officer wanting to escort him out of town before seeing the widow or attending the funeral. He was given a nice, friendly warning, but of course by now Bill's interests are really peaked. If he thought things were a bit strange with the widow's phone call, the police warning him off and escorting him out of town before he has a chance to see anyone, well now Bill has to stay and figure things out for himself. And boy does he ever get himself entangled in a lot of strange stuff along the way.

If you enjoyed ""The Last Call"" or ""Capitol Offense"" then you will really enjoy going on another thrill ride with Bill Travis. Bill Travis is just an ordinary guy who invests money for a living, yet he finds himself in some very strange situations. Pick up your copy today and take this journey home with Bill, you will not be disappointed and you will be thoroughly entertained."

Books_5,0,"Actually, having attended a number of academic conferences myself, I am not sure this is a satire. Quite a few of the ""fictitious"" presentations in this book sported titles (and contents) that were uncomfortably familiar. (What can I say? I was young...I didn't know any better...)  As for the back-biting, infighting, petty scheming, feuds, and general unmitigated nastiness--it's all too true. Fortunately, in Lodge's hands, it's also funny enough to take the sting out of some of the more pointed barbs.

And, if Lodge's lampoon of academia isn't enough to tickle your funny bone, you'll surely get a laugh out of the misguided kidnapping, adultery, unrequited love, requited love, strippers, porn, a journey around the world, and one of the most hilarious scenes in print (a karaoke bar in Tokyo that was definitely lost in translation).

Lodge's writing is a pleasure to read. He is clever (without being precious), ironic, poignant, even lyrical in places. As befitting a novel about literary criticism, there are references to everyone we know and love: Shakespeare (All's Well That Ends Well), Oscar Wilde (The Importance of Being Ernest--the twins are found in a Gladstone bag), and, naturally, the Grail Quest with all of its incumbent post-modernist/feminist permutations. I was thoroughly delighted to see that Lodge even referenced himself. (On page 280 Angelica's father bemoans the ignorance about identical twins. He mentions that he ""didn't have the patience"" to read a novel which featured identical twins of opposite sexes. The novel was David Lodge's ""Changing Places."")

You will find this book gut-wrenchingly funny if you are in academia.  If you are not, well, just enjoy your flight."

It's a little hard to get on the floor, but it's very sturdy and holds up very well. I'm not sure if the squeakers are the problem or not, but they're great.

Toys_and_Games_5,0,"Hard to use, and the crayons are really skinny and fall out/break easily. I recommend the egg shaped crayons by crayola that are all crayon with no plastic part if your child is under 2 or the super jumbo sized regular style crayons if your child is over 2."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"I purchased these to replace an old set of threaded dumbbell handles with rubber grips that were falling apart. The metal grip on these is a bit rough on the hands but that has been solved with a set of cheap work out gloves. As many other reviewers have stated the plates do begin to loosen over time and due to the lack of a rubber o-ring between the collars and plates and it can be difficult to tighten them down however i simply swapped on the collars from my old dumbbells which did have the o-ring and the plates stay in place better. Another solution i have found to tighten the collars is to rotate the plates in opposite directions which gives you more leverage on the collars and tightens them more securely.

Overall these handles feel solid and do exactly what they are made to do. I give them 4 stars only because of the plates becoming loose but as long as you pay attention to them and make sure they are tight they don't disrupt your workout too much"
Kindle_Store_5,1,I was thoroughly impressed with this book and the writing. I will definitely be reading the next one.
Pet_Supplies_5,0,My cat is quite used to me clipping her claws. I had no problem putting these on her. But I do recommend the clear ones as another poster said. It's easier to see how much glue you put in there.
Pet_Supplies_5,0,Puppies seem to love them! Stocked up for awhile. I will most likely buy again!!
Toys_and_Games_5,0,"This Snow White is great for younger girls. My 3 year old granddaughter loves Disney Princesses & asked for Snow White for her birthday.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Disney-Princess-Princess-Snow-White-Doll/dp/B00B86TDY4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Disney Princess Princess Snow White Doll</a>&nbsp;is from  the Disney Sparkling Princess collection by Mattel.
She is the size of a Barbie.
She can't stand alone; however her legs move at the hips.  Her knees don't bend.
The front of her bodice is  sparkly, molded plastic, but the back of her molded plastic bodice is not sparkly.
Snow White's hair is very stiff & shouldn't get messed up easily.
Her shoes will not stay on.  We're thinking of using double-sided sticky tape to see that will work. If that doesn't work, we might glue the shoes on...then again, we might forget about the shoes & let Snow White go barefoot.
Her skirt can be removed; the top piece of her skirt is sparkly.
Snow White has a plastic tiara that seems like it can't be pulled off. Granddaughter's sleeping with Snow White now, so I can't check.
Snow White's face is much prettier than it looks in Amazon's photo. Actually she looks better in person than in the product photo.

Sparkling Princess Snow White seems to be durable & is a good choice for a 3 year old who loves all the Disney princesses."

Pet_Supplies_5,0,I have three of these now because my cats love them.  My senior cat loves to lie in the bottom cubby as she's too arthritic to get on top.  But the other three younger cats all love lying on the top bed and looking out the window.  They use the scratch pad all of the time which is great because they don't paw my furniture.  Well worth the money.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,"Okay, so I finally got around to buying the tools. I did not need a screwdriver, but I had some old saws, and they were the best. I was very pleased with the tools. I used them to cut a strip of wood, and they worked great. The only thing I would change is I would not use the blades to cut a strip of wood if I could get my hands on them. I used them to cut a cut with a saw, and they were great. I would recommend this tool to anyone. I love these lamps. They are brighter than my old ceiling fan. I have used them for a couple of months now. They do work well for my purposes. The only issue is that I can't see them in my ceiling. I wish they were the ones that look like the ceiling lights. I would definitely recommend this lamp. Works as advertised. This is my second pair of these, and I really like the quality of the material and the design. They are very easy to install, and the rubber part of the handle is very easy to handle, and I like that it holds a bit more weight than the regular plastic handle. I don't have any problems with the quality of the finish, but it's a little tough, and if you're going to be using it for anything other than decorative purposes, it will not hold up to the use. I'm a homeowner and would definitely buy another pair. This is a very nice pair of LED lights, very bright. I have used them for a few projects and have been using them for a couple of days now."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"You will need to trim the foam to perfect specs, depending on your specific AK. You need to trim the muzzle break area according to your needs Cutaway is for a loaded AK and there are two additional cutouts for magazines. I had to trim the foam for the buttstock for my Yugo M70. Didn't leave much protection for butt-plate but its rubberized and fit nicely. I just wish they slid the whole gun cut out a little to the left. Pleanty of room to.  I made a third cutouts for a third magazine and then enlarges the ""ammo"" cutout to hold all the goodies, oil, grease, cleaning kit, Not much room to add any additional magazines so get out your magazine bag.  Fully loaded it is kind of heavy but manageable. Case seems durable and tough enough for the money. I have different set up for ""range day"", because I take a lot of different stuff, but this would work if it was all you were taking. I'm now ready for a SHTF or JIC scenario."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"I recently upgraded my brakes to Shimano Zee dual piston calipers to increase surface contact on gravity drops and needed to upgrade to a new  bracket (MA-F-180 S/P). This was used to fit an IS fork to a post mount caliper using a 180 rotor.  As usual Shimano continues to make perfect fitting high quality parts, it included the fixing bolts 2 X (M6x18.7mm) and a precision cut bracket.  To me the bolts seem a bit long, i'm used to a M6x15.2mm bolts.

Over great quality. Just make sure you know what bracket size and mount type before ordering."

My only slight complain is that sometimes the magnets are not positioned properly in the letters and they don't stick as well as they should. You can adjust them yourself tho and get it to work. If you get a few that slide down the frig, just look carefully at the positions of the magnets and adjust them so they are flush with the back of the letter/number.

After doing that they should stick well.

Out of 40 letters we only had to do that to 3 pieces so it's not too bad. And you can add additional magnets if you want."

As I said in my review of the stem, I was so happy when I sat on the bike after the conversion that I cried.

Thank you other reviewers and bloggers...you gave me the courage to order the parts and the ability to finally sit completely upright.  My full review of the products together and process is on the Sunlite stem page...I don't want to bore with repetition.  I will say, the handlebars seem like very good quality to me.  I like the straight front which will accept a basket, and the grip part was long enough for my vintage Schwinn grips plus brake levers.  I have downtube shifters and, as others have noted, there is not enough room on the straight back portion to have grips, shifters, and brakes.  But it worked for me.  I did as another reviewer reported and angled the bars down a little, so my wrists are in their natural, straight alignment when on the grips.  Am loving the whole set up!  Thank you amazon and thank you reviewers!"

Some of the animals look better than the people, and I'm not kidding!! The people pics are B&W and are from the 19th century, judging from the fashion styles seen. In turn, each player chooses one of the pictures to respond to a question asked, like ""Which one looks the grumpiest?"" Others try to guess which picture that played picked. You get to advance on the game board if you do. Then in another round, two pictures are shown, and the person whose turn it is must guess which of the two pictures a certain player submitted. First one to reach the Finish space wins.

A fun game that will provide laughs. Some of the pictures are hysterical. This game is out of print, but if you're looking for a party game to add to your collection, consider this one."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"This was a warehouse deal item but if I bought another, I'd pay full price.  This had a scratch in it that I keep looking at over and over.  The thermos holds quite a bit of coffee for me.  This is a tall, thin thermos so it is easy to hold.  I have the teal color and it is a very nice shade.  The top screws on and has to be lined up perfectly to get this to go on and make sure you tighten it down real good or you'll get your beverage leaking out.  I usually put lids on so tight my husband cannot get them off and with this, even with tightening this down the way I usually do, it was not tight enough.  The top center has a small button to push  up or down to open or close it, that works good.  There is also a small hook inside to hold a tea bag.  I haven't used that feature yet but I will.  That is different and will come in handy.

02/23 update - I filled this up with coffee today and screwed the top on and the silver band split and there is about a 1/8 inch gap now in the top.  It seems to not cause any spill of the coffee yet, but we'll see.  Maybe this wasn't such a good deal after all.

03/08 - Another update.  This was a sale one day recently and I bought a silver one with a black top to take to work.  Do not buy the silver with the black top!  You cannot see where the opening is for the beverage to come out and I spill hot coffee on my cheek and clothing about 80 percent of the time.  Since I used this, I will probably have to make some scratch marks in the lid so I know when the opening is.  This will be better than a burned red face."

If you haven't read Bridget Jones's Diary yet you may be more impressed by the originality of this. Of course lack of originality doesn't detract from entertainment value. Maybe we should just accept that there is now a genre/category (sometimes called called chick-lit) within which some authors chose to write. The heroine, called Jane Goodall is pre-occupied with a man who rejects her (plot lifted from Virgil's about Aeneas and Dido) and plans revenge (plot lifted from Euripides about Medea and Jason) which she does by writing  (derived from evo-psychology) magazine articles about why men are unfaithful to their lovers. The quotations from animal behavior studies are among the best jokes.
  It has some penetrating insights and funny satirical patches and it kept me interested and reading to the end."

I got my first pair of these at a bargain price.  These work well and the extra size is great.  I am using them in the shop to cover a lot of concrete.I had no issues with this product.I use it as a ""t-handle"" with no problems.  I have the most common type of faucet I have found and it is very easy to install.  I used it to replace a broken faucet in a home that had a sink sink that was not as well built.  This one worked well and is very durable.  The color is a good mix of red, white and warm white.  I am very pleased with this product and would recommend to anyone.This is a great tool for getting things done at home.  It is sturdy, holds a great amount of torque, and is very well made.  I recommend this tool to anyone who needs a tool for tight spaces, and this is a great tool for that.  The only complaint I have is that it does not come with the charger.

Movies_and_TV_5,0,"There are two things that might be of interest to some viewers. One is that director of ""Solstice"" is Daniel Myrick, who co-directed a hugely successful horror ""The Blair Witch Project"" in 1999 (with Eduardo Snchez). The other is his latest film stars Shawn Ashmore (""Iceman"" of the ""X-Men"" franchise) and Amanda Seyfried (a young bride-to-be in ""Mamma Mia!""). As a horror film, however, ""Solstice"" offers little more than familiar scares and ineffective narrative despite its stars, beautifully shot photography and some intriguing narrative elements.

""Solstice"" follows the story of Megan (Elisabeth Harnois) trying to recover from one shocking incident that happened to her family, and her friends Christian, Zoe, Mark and Alicia. They travel to a quiet lake house for their annual summer trip, where Megan starts experiencing strange things, like seeing things. Megan comes to believe that some supernatural presence is trying to contact her, perhaps her twin sister Sophie, to let Megan know some secrets. Or maybe she is mistaken.

I can't reveal it in detail, but in the second half of the film an interesting development takes place as Megan realizes the truth about the weird images she continues to see. But the film's slow-paced earlier part is boring with clichd devices such as moving shadows and a ""creepy"" old guy (R. Lee Ermey). In the end of the film everything is explained and some of the characters, including R. Lee Ermey's ""Leonard,"" show unexpected sides, but it takes too long (more than 50 minutes) before the film reaches that point.

According to the opening credit, ""Solstice"" is based on a 2003 Danish film ""Midsommer."" Perhaps something is lost in translation. Perhaps not. Whichever it is, I feel there is a better movie buried in here."

Toys_and_Games_5,0,These have strong magnets and attach very easy to the fridge. My 2 year old got these for his birthday and we had fun talking about animals and he tried to name them all (though made some mistakes).  I think he will really enjoy these for many years to come. I did notice the sticker on one is already starting to separate on an edge though so I will need to glue it before we play more.  Also you'll want to make sure not to give these to kids that put everything in their mouth because my older son accidentally gave a letter to my younger son while I was cooking one day and just a few seconds with an edge in the mouth left the edge crummy looking.  I also like Melissa and Doug's containers but wish this had a plastic sliding piece like our alphabet and numbers for easy stacking (and staying in the container if the stack falls).

Books_5,0,I have read and own every WEB Griffin book written to include the ones that his son 'helped' write or wrote completely. I can tell easily what was written by father and what was written by son. And while the son is growing as a writer...he is not at the level of his father. The marketing of this book makes it seem like WEB Griffin wrote it and to me it seems almost fraudulent for book seller to market the book as such. I will have to decide on the release of the next book if it is even worth buying.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"This could potentially be an outstanding tool, but for a few unfortunate short-cuts and oversights.
Short-cut: detachable legs, designed no doubt to ship in a smaller box and possibly save manufacture expense.  My saw rocks back and forth across two opposite corners because my legs are not straight.  An accurately cast one-piece base would solve this.
Short-cut: cheesy plastic clamps that are awkward to use because the holes in the clamping tensioner through which the clamp rods pass do not align easily, and because in the angle-clamp mode the second part of the tensioner assembly that allows use at an angle does not attach to the main tensioner, but rather aligns loosely, requiring something of a juggling act to assemble the three items for angle-use.
Oversight: the clamp is not usable in its normal configuration (through the back, in the v-slot on the bed) for thinner narrow stock laid flat to miter cut because the clamping foot won't rotate far enough down.
Short-cut: mysteriously, the manufacturer takes the time to give a tutorial on geometry required to lay out angles for frames/boxes that are regular polygons, and even gives tips on saw usage, but provides crappy wordless diagrams for most of the assembly of the tool (which is not totally intuitive and takes a little keen observation to pull off.)  Annoying.

I want to note that the vendor I bought from (they sell through Amazon, so this is appropriate to mention), The Best Things, is a good company and I would not hesitate to give them my business.  But I cannot recommend the Nobex saw."

No dead/bright/stuck pixels on the unit I received, which was a great start.  It's a very thin panel, not much weight to it at all, and the bezel is small and looks nice.  The included stand is garbage, like most at this price point - I'd recommend a VESA mount to give you more ability to adjust the height and angle.  Watching streaming video online worked well, and the screen kept up with fast motion in action movies, but brightness is an issue sometimes - best to keep this monitor in a darker room.  Overall, it's a good monitor for little money - just not great.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"This is an exact OEM replacement for my 24V/80lb iPilot Riptide ST, and presumably other similar models.  This is a great unit and meets my every expectation.

Linking is snap.  Hit the learn button on the head of the iPilot and hit any button on the remote.  You will get a confirmation beep.  That's it.

This stays on as long as your iPilot is on.  As the remote battery ages, the remote will go to sleep on you.  This is normal. I have never experienced any other disconnection or difficulty with linking with the original remote or this replacement.  When the remote goes to sleep, the trolling motor keeps doing whatever it was doing.

If you are having trouble linking remote or are losing connection (other than the sleep mode to save battery on the remote), it is more likely that your iPilot unit is going bad.  Keep that in mind before you throw this product under the bus.  These remotes are solid as a rock.

I recommend having at least two methods to control your trolling motor.  This remote plus the foot pedal, or two of these remotes, or one of these remote and one mini remote, etc.  Also, having a couple extra batteries on board is a good idea.  The batteries last me about 10-12 months with moderate use, and replacements can store unused for 3 years or more.  You do get some warning that the battery is dying, but not super accurate.

This does not include the fancy Minn Kota lanyard.  The product description does not say that it is included.  Minn Kota website does not say it is included.  I don't know where people are getting the idea that this product brings the lanyard.  To be clear, this product does not bring the lanyard.  It is the remote unit with the battery installed.  That's it.  Do not take away stars from an otherwise stellar product because you wanted more that was supposed to come with the product."

Toys_and_Games_5,0,"My four-year-old daughter loves Disney Junior, and while she'll watch Miles from Tomorrowland, it's never been one of her favorites. As a result, this Photon Flyer was our first Miles toy. My daughter apparently recognized the craft from the show and immediately began to play with it.

Although the Miles figure glows and the wings light up, it's actually pretty basic for a toy vehicle these days.  The wings fold back a little for ""surface mode,"" and the nose of the craft can slightly extend for ""hyper speed mode,"" but that's about it. On the one hand, it opens a door for fun and imagination, but I think my youngest was a bit disappointed that it didn't at least make sounds.

Of course, this Photon Flyer works best when combined with other Miles toys that we do not have. It fits into a sold-separately toy called the Stellosphere, which -- according to the box -- ""amps up"" this toy with sounds, more lights, and larger wings. So at the moment, our vehicle is not ""amped up,"" nor do we have accessories (none included) to store in the ship's cute cargo hold. Although my daughter creatively put some Lion Guard stuff in there and promptly added Lion Guard figures to her Miles missions. And finally, the box prominently shows the Merc figure (not included) who has his own custom seat and moon roof in the flyer.

All in all, if you have other Miles toys already, this Photon Flyer is a great addition to any collection. It works great with other figures, accessories, and the Stellosphere set. If, like us, it's all on its own in the Miles universe, you'll likely be encouraged by your child to expand your collection... Unless they want to enlist other friends, like the Lion Guard, in their space adventures."

Books_5,0,"I would definitely not recommend this J. Grisham book to anyone. I have been a fan of his books for years and this is not up to his usual caliber. It's as if someone else wrote it ( someone who doesn't have anything constructive to say). There is no redeeming social value to the protagonist's actions and if this is what I am to expect from future Grisham novels, then I won't be reading them. K."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"I bought these because they popped up as a sale item. I normally buy more expensive jeans.  I figured these would be good cheap jeans for wearing around house. But once they arrived I realized how nice they are. Looked great and comfortable. I typically wear a 32 waste but have been needing 33 waste lately. These were 33 waste and fit perfect. The legs were a little tight, but not bad. I normally wear a looser fit. This were by no means skinny jeans."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,I love this knife!! I use it everyday with my AR-15 and my AR-15 fits great.  I had to replace a couple of the plastic plastic ones to get it to work properly.

It is very easy to carry and is very useful. He will buy more for his wife!I bought this for a friend who has a small head and he uses it for just
Books_5,0,"""Fallen Dragon"" is an awesome sci-fi novel by an incredible talent in the genre.  Some of these reviews compare the novel unfavorably to Hamilton's ""Night's Dawn"" trilogy, but I think it's rather better:  while ND is an epic space opera which draws strength from both its exploration of posthuman themes and grand drama on a cosmic scale, Fallen Dragon's strength is in its focus on characters and a far more mature style than was evident in ND.  Fallen Dragon basically focuses on three characters and their involvement in the travails surrounding a particular colony world (though these events have implications for all human society, one eventually discovers), and this focus helps to create a strong storyline and character development that really matters to the reader."

The only thing that I do like about it is the size of the hat. My son is 4 and loves to play with it. He's also the youngest one in the house and it is a little challenging for him to hold the pieces together. I think it is really cute."

Previously, Nutro Large Breed Adult Farm-Raised Chicken, Brown Rice & Sweet Potato Recipe dog food was a big hit. Now they have tried Nutro canned food:  Limited Ingredient Diet Adult Fish & Potato Recipe.

The Husky, Indy, is a particularly picky eater. No problem, though. He and all of his canine buddies loved the new food. Indy ate his bowl clean. Zelda, the Lab, seems to have more energy now. Sebastian and Bishop loved it too."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"We bought the matching Delta Soap Dispenser,RP71543RB, to the Cassidy High Rise Pull Down kitchen faucet - 9197-RB-DST.  Also bought the matching Dishwasher Air Gap.

The rubbed bronze finish was excellent and matched the Cassidy faucet.  The quality of construction was excellent.  The push down handle did not look cheap and feels like it will hold up to use.  The shape and size was really very good.  The bottle is very large, holds 10 ounces and can be filled from the top by simply removing the top push down handle.  Hint:  Use the funnel and no drops go on the counter top.  Instructions are on the back of the box.

Installation was quick and easy.

The shape of the base of the soap dispenser is very nice and the pinata was excellent.  The appearance is excellent and it looks great with the Cassidy faucet.  It doesn't look cheap like a lot of soap dispensers.  It's also considerably cheaper than a Moen soap dispenser.

We have only used the pump a few days so these are our comments."

I wanted a great, functional, and functional product that would last a long time. I am very pleased with this product. It works well, but I do not recommend it.

I have a friend who has a broken one, so I was a little skeptical of this purchase. I did not realize that this would work well, but I thought it would be nice to have an option for a replacement. I have a little older sister who is a metalworker, and this works well for her. I would not have bought this product if I had known that it would work well for her. This product is great for that.

I received this product at a discount"

Grip is superb, they are supple and light, and they are QUIET. Really quiet.

If you are worried about the lack of tread, please research. Slicks give superior dry/wet traction in most conditions.

They look great too."
Books_5,0,"I just got this.  It's nice.  Lots of cool pics. The pics in overall review is pretty accurate.  Pages seem good. About same thickness as Magic Garden. As pics on both sides of pages.  I can't tell about make leak thru yet.
My only complaint is a good chunk (3/4) of pics go thru the middle seam. So that's gonna be a problem getting at. As far as I can tell pages are not perforated either. I like the book tho so I'll make it work. The pics seem pretty original. Big pics that take up the whole page.
I plan on attacking the book with markers. Most of the pics will require fine line markers. Some pics have big areas but almost every pic had areas of small details as seen in main summary. A couple of pages are empty of the small details- some are blank for you to detail your own. Ex butterflies etc. Least that's what is says up in corner of page.
It also apparently is kind of a search and find book too, tiny objects to find within the pics....with answers in the back. So its interactive. Good for all ages.
So for the price. I'm a very happy camper and can't wait to get my new markers in the mail and get going.

Side note. There are pages where the book left blanks for you to draw or fill then in. There are approx 14 of those out of about 43 actual coloring pages. The regular pgs still sold me the book. About 6 pgs of answers in the back."
Toys_and_Games_5,0,Very fun but not durable at all.  Falls apart and breaks easily.  We don't play with it long because there isn't much to it but the people are fun to play on our other play sets and the kids enjoy using the launcher.  Definitely not worth full price.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,I've been using the Saleae (Cordless) bulb for about a year now and I'm very pleased with the quality and the look.

I have a few of them in the house and they are bright enough to see in the dark. I have a few of them on my bathrooms and a few in the kitchen.
Kindle_Store_5,0,"Desire: The Dining Club: Part One is the first short story in an eight part series. Since this is a short story, this review will be brief.

I don't really have much to say about it. The writing isn't awful, but it grows a bit redundant, vocabulary-wise (for example, David says a lot of things quietly).

My main issue is as follows: nothing happens in this first book. It feels like someone took the first chapter of a novel and released it independently. This first part only discusses what the club is, and that Grace is to visit. You don't really learn about the characters much and they come off as cold.

This novella gets two stars based on the concept. I'd very much like to see how this goes. However, I'm not going to collect pieces of eight like it's some kind of literary trading card. I'd rather just wait until they're all out and read them as one full length book than sit through snippets like this. I'd very much recommend that other readers do the same.

Thanks to Netgalley and Forever (Grand Central Publishing) for my copy in exchange for an honest review."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,The picture posted for this item is a fraud. It shows 3 pots and 2 pans with 2 lids. What you actually get are 3 pots and 2 lids.  It is very deceptive and this company should be ashamed. To return it you have to pay a 20% restocking fee. Very disappointed.
Toys_and_Games_5,0,"I have been discovering Ravensburger puzzles recently and really enjoying them. For those not familiar with the brand: Ravensburger puzzles are some of the highest quality puzzles you can buy. I've noticed that store-bought puzzles in the box stores have been getting cheaper in recent years -- not in price, but in materials (thinner cardboard, poor quality image prints). Not these! These puzzles are made of thick stock cardboard, and they're printed nicely (usually with a cool canvas texture).

I am particularly fond of this one, as I'm a foodie and love spices. I think this one may get framed and mounted in my dining room."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"Would give it a five store but as you probably know it is lots n lots of parcel board. It is very easy to put together, except the knobs stink, they were very hard to screw in and very cheap like everyone else commented. My biggest problem is it wasn't very deep, so if you are like me and passed up reading the measurements then this might be good knowing. I had bought mine to put towels in but it cannot fit them, so now I store toilet paper in it. Anyhow, other than that it looks nice fully functional other then it needing additional shelving inside :)"

Books_5,0,"This book was quite interesting to me. I agree that many people, even Christians can't handle laments. Most of us are silenced and reduced to ""faking fine. "" No one really wants to know anything about the negative. But everyone seems to be a counselor and offers advice that's unwanted and unneeded. I couldn't relate to the author's neverending supply of supportive friends who helped her all along the way with her issues. I found myself wanting to feel more sorry for her lack of relationship with her family, but I had some questions. She left her brother out of her story almost altogether. How did he react to events?

I couldn't relate to the somewhat shallow craving for shopping and closets full of shoes. I don't lament things. I'm not into prosperity gospel. And who gets to go on a long retreat to Alaska to heal? Almost none of us. I think I was hoping for more of a workbook than a personal account. The book touches on a lot of good points about biblical laments in Psalms, Job, Lamentations. Some of the stories became repetitive and I think it could have been condensed a bit. The book is a good commentary of realizing that many of us are not ""just fine."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,YAY!  We were able to assemble the pieces and put them together.

Kindle_Store_5,1,I was provided a copy of this book by the author for an honest review. I was not compensated for my review. All opinions are my own. I enjoyed this book. I enjoyed the characters and the plot. I would like to read more from this author. It was a good book and a good read. I will read more by this author.

Movies_and_TV_5,0,"I rented this video from the library and as soon as I was finished, I came onto Amazon and ordered it. I like Chris Freytag, she is a good instructor and she is upbeat. I like the different combinations(I especially like playing catch in one of the segments)  I worked up the sweat that I am used to working up."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,Smells good but no foam.  I put it in three different foaming dispensers and NO FOAM just gel oozing out.  Bummed me out but I can still wash my  hands with the gel.  Just wanted foam. Got the wrong thing I guess.
Electronics_5,0,"Don't ask me how they make money on this...it is a well-made product, and it cost me five bucks with free shipping. I don't get it! (And I ain't complainin'!)

I use it with my Kindle Paperwhite (2014). The fit isn't perfect, as it is designed for the Fire, but it works just fine. Inside there is a tab in each of the corners to hold down the tablet. Since this isn't spec'd for the Paperwhite, it doesn't fit in those tabs, so it can slide around. But only just barely, and since it ships with a styrofoam insert (to keep its shape during shipping), I use that for extra protection and it works great. So I definitely recommend this for other Kindle Paperwhite (or equivalent-sized e-reader) owners."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,The leash is great but I had ordered blue and received a black one. Not a huge deal so I kept it.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"These have held up well to repeated use for water storage/transport in packs. They are a bit stiff, but do roll up well. I have no complaints other than I would like to have more and wish they were less expensive. A good product I would recommend."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Over a year ago, I bought a B&D 20V Max drill/driver, which has become indispensable. The 20V battery pack seems to last ""forever.""  Based on this experience, I set about replacing my old Sears 19.8V tool set with Black & Decker 20V Max tools. (The Sears batteries were no longer capable of retaining a charge long enough to be useful.)  The BDCCS20B circular saw is a new addition to the 20V Max family.  It serves me well for trimming shelves and various projects around the house.  And unlike the old circular saw, I don't have to stop every half hour to replace the battery pack. My new 20V Max tool set also includes the recip saw (also reviewed) and the edger/trimmer.  I will continue to rely on Black & Decker for more 20V Max tools!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"I thought I was buying this to make it easier for me to cook. My hubby was so excited to try it that he's taken it over and I haven't cooked in it once. It's made it even easier than I thought to make dinner! ;-)
It also works really well for crafty things. My daughters and I have used the keep warm feature to make our own lip balm and hard lotion bars, which were really nice Christmas gifts."
Electronics_5,1,"I recently received my order and it arrived on time. I will keep my review in order to share my experiences.  The plastic parts are very sturdy, and the cover is very sturdy.  The only complaint I have is that the case is very thin and doesn't protect the tablet perfectly.  It is very difficult to keep it in place, especially when you are looking for a case for your tablet.  I highly recommend it to anyone looking"
Kindle_Store_5,1,"This is somewhat similar to what happens in the first book of the series, but the author has done a great job of describing the characters. The characters are not predictable, and it's easy to see why. The main characters are likable, and the story keeps you interested until the very end. I did get a little confused about the book title, which is a good thing because there's not a lot of overlap."
Movies_and_TV_5,1,"Just as Karloff, Lugosi and Rosario Dawson are the most talented in the world, the other three are the worst.  The movie is a mess, the acting is terrible, and the movie is a sad little movie.  I would have liked to have seen more of the series.  I don't think I would have gotten it.  I hope they make a sequel.  I wish I would have known more about the show and the characters.  It's very sad.I remember when I was a kid, I used to watch this movie on TV, and I was a little confused by it.  I remember watching it with my friends and my grandkids.  I had never seen this movie, so I didn't know what to expect.  I was a little worried that they would find out the truth behind it, but I was a little disappointed.  I don't know why the people who did this didn't get this movie, but I guess I just didn't expect it to be so funny.  I guess it was supposed to be funny, but I guess it was more like ""One More Time"" and that would have made it more interesting.  I guess it was just a little too far fetched, but it was worth watching.  I think it was really good.  I think that people who are not interested in the movie should watch the movie and not buy it.  The movie is pretty good, but I would have thought that this movie would have been better if it was a little more complicated."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,"I rarely write reviews but this review is an important one.

The opener is strong and sturdy.  The jaws are plastic, but they're not plastic, so you don't have to worry about it breaking.  I've used it for about 20 days and it's not going to break.  I've tried it with a cordless drill and it worked well.  I've had it for about a month now and it's working great.  I would recommend this tool for any electrical contractor.

The included instructions are fairly straightforward and you can put them in a text file, but the instructions are mostly just a bunch of stupid ""javascript"" letters.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it's not"
Movies_and_TV_5,0,"This was a Christmas gift for my 3 year old grandaughter. She loves these T.V. shows & she learns a lot from them (she can count up to 10, knows all of her shapes & colors,  knows the letters of the alphabet, can understand & speak some -a fairly good amount of- Spanish, her vocabulary is way above the level of a 3 year old, and she can read some words in books).  She amazes a lot of people & they always ask where she learns these things. We feel she enjoys herself learning from her ""friends"" on T.V. She also has their books.  I have a DVD player in my car & I have a selection of these shows on separate DVDs which she loves. Now she can see them all on 1 DVD (we use the DVD player in town & it's not always convenient to change a DVD when driving). This DVD will be especially good for the long trips we take (over 2 hours). Anyone with little ones will know how much education kids can absorb while watching something they enjoy! I highly recommend this DVD."

There is no deep thinking or new discoveries within the covers, and if you are looking for a ""destination"", you will not find one. But if you are willing to enjoy a small journey into the land of brands then you will find beauty and grace and be rewarded for that. A refreshing read, some of the things we all know, some are new found discoveries.... My company is doing web and graphic design and multimedia, and lots of our people like this book very much."

Pet_Supplies_5,0,"Absorbs odor very well. Switched to it from tidy cats and my cat loves it. One time, I had to switch back to tidy cats for the week (due to poor planning on my part- had to get whatever the gas station had) and my cat very unhappy! She let me know she didn't want to use her box unless it had the precious cat litter in it by leaving me a little ""present"" next to the box when it was the tidy cats litter. So now I stock this stuff religiously and we have no problems. I think she likes that it's unscented and I like that it works so well. I used to buy these 40lb bags via PrimeNow(cat litter to your door in less than 2 hours? Yes please!) but the drivers in my area must have complained about the weight because now they only carry the smaller bag. I wish it was on Prime Subscribe and Save.

My one pet peeve about this product: it's dense meaning from a volume perspective you actually get less. I store the bag in an old (cleaned out) tidy cats pail and that's how I know that one 40lb bag of Precious cat takes up barely slightly more volume as one 24lb pail of Tidy Cats. I'd say 30lbs Precious Cat probably equals 24lbs Tidy Cats. I don't think it's a big deal. The added density is probably why it's less dusty and clumps better than other litter brands. But if you're like me and fill the litter box to a certain volume all the time, it's just something to think about when deciding how much/often to order."

Movies_and_TV_5,0,"The overall production quality of ""Lansky"" is barely adequate. This HBO TV special comes across as a film made under severe time and financial constraints. Nonetheless, the acting talent of Richard Dreyfuss is utterly fantastic. The now middle-aged star gives a performance that ranks among his very best. Dreyfuss clearly understands this low keyed Jewish gangster who lead much of American organized crime in the previous century. The character actor Max Perlich also does a splendid job of portraying Lansky during his earlier years. Perlich is a skillful thespian who deserves greater respect and attention. He ought to have received at least an Academy Award nomination for his splendid supporting work in ""Rush.""
Meyer Lansky was something of a highly intelligent mob boss who essentially perceived himself as a misunderstood polite business man; neither better nor worse than the titans of that era's capitalist business organizations. Lansky rationalizations conveniently ignored the fact that murder and other forms of violence are not everyday realities of conventional American capitalism. Lansky, though, was probably correct to conclude that FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover and Senator Estes Kefauver hounded him mostly out of less than noble reasons.
""Lansky"" accurately depicts the Jewish gangsters as far more intelligent than those generally found in other ethnic groups. Also, the Meyer Lanskys, ""Bugsy"" Siegels, and Alfred Rothsteins were the only generation of that ethnic tradition that chose careers in organized crime. Their progeny did not follow in their father's footsteps! Meyer Lansky, for instance, made sure that his own son attended West Point and became a U.S. military officer. ""Lansky"" earns four stars. I highly recommend this movie if you are someone genuinely interested in understanding the motivations of a Meyer Lansky. He may not be an American hero, but Lansky cannot be ignored if you truly desire to comprehend the difficulties of many to assimilate into our national culture."

The book is written as if it were a biography, but it is a detailed account of the life of a young man. This is a very good book.I was looking forward to reading the book, but had to wait a bit for the ending. I liked the ending, but I did not like the way it was written.This is a great book for any college student. The author provides insight into the lives of many people, and makes them feel at home.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"This is a rather surprising purchase in several ways.  This sandal is soft gold colored,  lightweight, soft plastic but substantial enough with an innersole. The thong strap is comfortable for all day use. The foldable aspect is no problem. You are not aware of the foldable feature when wearing them. It comes with 2 very substantial bands to hold each sandal in a folded position or as a pair with one band. I rather like the bright color bands! The flip-flops have their own durable just the right size zip carryall bag in black with a nice embroider front. Each sandal can be fold in half and banded or unfold and banded as a pair in the bag.  The sandal was not too snug or tight to the foot. I wanted room especially for hot weather comfort but not overly wide either."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"After reading every review on deep fryers I could find, I finally decided on this one.  It has been great and I couldn't ask for anything better or more easy to use.

I put it on my cooktop and let my big hood suck away any odors.  It heats up quickly and the food has always come out great.  We made donuts after cooking shrimp and halibut with no cross-odors or tastes!  My family only tolerates fish, so this was greatly appreciated.

Cleanup is easy also.  After waiting for the oil to cool, the pan, lid and rack can go into the dishwasher.  Only the heating element has to be cleaned by hand and it is quite easy.  The oil can be used many times without problems and so it is more economical to use than I originally thought it would be.

I would recommend this with no caveats."

The only downside is that the range is a bit narrow.  The TV is not wide enough, so that means it takes up a lot of space.  I wish it had a bit more width for the corners.  I have a 2.5"" Sony LCD TV with a Sony projector and the Sony speakers are great.  I wish there was more on the way.

The only thing that could have improved is the sound, but I would have preferred a better sound stage.  This TV is a bit bigger than I would have liked, but it is not as big as I wanted it to be.  I would have preferred to have a wall mounted speakers.  I would have preferred a sound stage that could be the best looking in the room.  I would have liked the fact that the TV is a little longer than I would have liked.

Overall, this is a great buy and I would recommend it.  I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a Sony TV for a very reasonable price.I bought this keyboard for my daughter and she loves it.  It's a little smaller than the typical keyboard, but it's a little lighter than she expected.  It works really well for my needs and is well-made.  The only thing I wish was that it had a tab to adjust the volume, which it doesn't do.  She has this keyboard now for her iPad, but I can't imagine that"

My kids young and old (3-11 years) enjoy making mama crabby....because mama is sometimes crabby right?  Anywho, this potato is a lot of fun.  My kids really like mixing all the different pieces and creating some rather interesting Potato peeps. The quality of the pieces and potato body are very good. Some of her pieces are a bit hard to push in but I suspect that they will loosen up with continued play.  We have not attempted to store her pieces in her ahem....behind.  No idea if they all fit.

Books_5,1,"Wow. I expected better from this author, but it just wasn't.

The premise of the story is simple enough: the story takes place in the beginning of the decade, and the characters are well developed. The main character, Zachary, is a rich man who has been with the military for many years, and is also a military-minded man who feels that he is a part of something larger than himself.  But he is not.  He is a man who is not his father, but is the son of a man who is not his father."
Electronics_5,1,"I wanted higher capacity than this. The only problem is that it's only 2. 5"" diameter. If you want to use your iPad with this, you'll need a 4"" diameter. The only way to get this size is to use the iPad with an adapter. I haven't used it with a portable player, but I'll try it with a portable charger. Update: This review has been updated with an additional review. This product is great, it works great, it works, it has a really nice feel and it fits great. Pros:
-Good quality, great sound
-Convenient to have a usb port on the front
-Good value for a small compact device
-Good price
-Convenient to have a usb port on the front

Cons:
-The sound is terrible, the volume is terrible, the battery life is horrible, and the battery is a little short. I'm going to try and replace this with a mini USB charger, but I'll be getting another one soon. I have not used this product in a remote control unit or anything else, and I have not tried it with any of the other devices I have tried. I have also tried it with a tablet and a small laptop. I had this product on my phone for about 2 weeks, and it works fine, and I have been happy with it."

Books_5,1,"Beautifully written, tense with suspense, and an easy read.  I will keep my eyes peeled for the next book by B.B. King.  The characters are well developed, and the story is well told.  Highly recommended."
Books_5,0,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""Double Fudge"". . . This book once again focuses on the book's main character Farley Drexel Hatcher (B.K.A. ""Fudge""). He is absolutely hilarious in this book. His obsession with money, his twin cousins and their little brother nicknamed ""Mini"", along with their parents are another interesting twist in this story. Peter Hatcher, Fudge's  older brother, who is now an official ""junior high school student"",  typically experiences all of the anxiety that is associated with  early adolesence.
This book made me laugh and laugh, especially the reaction of Mr. Hatcher when he discovers that their his cousins  want to stay at their house longer than a week.
I was also able to put myself in  many of the situations and generally grasp a feel each of the characters.
The first book that I ever read in the Fudge series was ""Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing"" followed by ""Superfudge"". I can remember attending Jefferson Elementary School in Little Rock, Arkansas waiting in line for what seemed like an infinity, to have first bid on checking out that book. I became a ""reader beaver"" thanks to Judy Blume and the wonderful staff at Jefferson Elementary who encouraged all students to build their foundation through reading. I used to walk swifly through the library with the rest of my classmates running straight towards the ""B"" fiction section --shouting, ""Ready or not here I come.""
This is an excellent read, and it is authors like Judy Blume who grasp the interest of young readers by  making her work interesting and identifiable to young readers. Thank you Ms. Judy Blume for providing great reading material for children of all ages!"

On top of that they just love my girlfriend which means if I didn't have this the restful vacation is pretty much toast. But for the last four nights its worked like a charm. I find it paricularly pleasing that the mosquitos that somehow made it into the room will have to go hungry for another night. It was incredibly easy to use, works well fit easily over a double size bed in our resort and it makes me look good since she thought I was over doing it when I ordered it. So far she's happy -  sleeps through the night and so I am happy and get to sleep through the night! It's light, small and easy to pack - even comes with a small hook for easy installation.

So I had to attach it to the outside of his cage...which kind of defeated the purpose of his sleeping in it at night. But it is well made, and when he is out, he likes it. NOW if only they would make one with a roof, and string it on metal chain for hanging instead of rope I would be so HAPPY!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"These ice packs are perfect for my family. We are slowly integrating our children into school after years of homeschooling and now have to deal with sending a lunch - mostly sandwiches or other cold items. I needed something to keep the food cold for just a few hours, but not too bulky either.

These thin, bread size ice packs are perfect. They are less than  thick and like I said the size of a slice of bread. They fit perfectly into a Bento lunchbox we own and even a small metal box. (I have included pictures so you can see.) Plus, being so thin a sandwich or other food items still fit in the container. So many of my other ice packs are bulky and take up so much room I have no space left for the food.

The ice pack stays cool long enough to keep the food chilled until lunch time. And if I feel the food needs some extra coldness, due to the thin nature of the ice pack, I can place one on the bottom and one on the top.

They are easy to clean. I just rinse them off, or if they get quite a bit of food on them, I just wash in some sudsy water. They re-chill quickly in the freezer and are always ready for the next day. Plus, again due to the thinness, they do not take up a huge amount of space in my already cramped freezer. And, the best part, being a hard plastic they do not get holes and leak all over. I have had way too many ice packs leak.

One thing I'd like to add is the ice pack has a ""food"" side and a ""lid"" side. I don't see a difference?

Pros:
Thin (less than  thick)
Size of a slice of bread
Keep food cold for at least 4 hrs.
Hard plastic and do not leak
Easy cleaning
Do not take up a lot of space in the freezer

Cons:
Do not stay cold all day

I was given the ice packs for free in exchange for my opinion and review."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"I've been using these as condiment bottles, filled with condiments from our bulk sized containers. The tips are pretty small, but I like that for condiments that aren't meant to be chunky (so, not relish). I started using one for pancakes awhile back, and occasionally the tip would get clogged from the batter, I noticed then that the tips are pretty thick, and I couldn't cut through one to change the size. I ended up taking a sharp knife with a fine point and kind of carved away at the opening to make it just a bit bigger. A friend also took a file type thing to hers, it's like a long chopstick, but the entire surface was a file.
Anyways, I've liked these well enough, and I'm glad I got them."

The cards are a bit messy for the most part, but once you get the hang of it, it's pretty fun.  There is a lot of replayability in this set, and there is a lot of depth to it.  The cards are very easy to play, and the art is pretty good.  You can play with any of the eight different sets, and it's really easy to play.  The cards are also very well made, and the art is pretty good.  There are also a lot of different ways to play, and the rules are pretty clear.  You can also play with the different sets of cards, but I think this is really fun.  Overall, a great set for any kid.Great game for the kids.

I can't wait to read the next one. I am on the fence about what to expect from this author. I was looking forward to reading the book, but had to wait a bit for the ending. I liked the ending, but I wish there was more. I enjoyed this book. I love how the heroine is a strong heroine. The story is very well written and I liked how she is in a relationship with her man. I like that the story is not over. I love how the heroine is a strong woman and the relationship is not over. It is a cute romance. I would recommend it.

We have a HDTV, surround sound with receiver, two video game systems, a DVD player, a Roku, wires going to the speakers and a cable box. Our television is mounted up on the stand's mounts so the wires are dangling and also bunched up on the floor behind the stand. By using this, I was able to group all the wires and cords together then run them up in a single Promaster sleeve so it looks like a pipe coming up from the ground instead of a bunch of dangling wires. The floor has no clutter at all now. What I did was plan everything before starting it. I think it could become frustrating if not planned out. It only took about 20-25 minutes to do all this and now we have a nice and neat entertainment area."

Pet_Supplies_5,0,"My dog has had skin bacteria issue on and off for a while because of his age and immunity.  I read the reviews on this item and had tried the Zymox brand for his ear yeast infections and this stuff performed pretty miraculously.

The shampoo is amazingly rich and thick.  It smells good and does a much better job than following up my dog's bath with a vinegar rinse which is what I was doing before to get rid of the skin issues.  However, my sensitive dog hated, really hated the vinegar rinse and it would stress him out so much that I had to find another solution.  I tried this and he was pleasantly surprised as was I.  This gets to the deep areas beneath the coat easily and doesn't just sit on the surface of the skin.  I followed the instructions about letting it sit for 3-5 minutes and I let it set for five and more.  The shampoo is easy to rinse out and really leaves his skin feeling soft.  After his bath, he does not show the normal irritation of moving from one position in the house to the next.  He seems more settled and not trying to escape the itch.  After his bath, I inspected the areas and they were almost as pink as the rest of his normal skin.

But don't be fooled!  Bacteria and fungus invasions are nothing to play around with.

Movies_and_TV_5,1,"Jamie Blanks' 2001 ""Valentine"" is a real standout.  The film is a turn-based action adventure.  There are a few twists, but the movie is very action-oriented.  The action sequences are well done.  Some of the special effects are very good.  The special effects are a bit too intense.  Overall, ""Valentine"" is a solid movie.  I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys action and adventure.I like this movie very much.  I have watched it about 1,000 times, and I am not sure how many times it has been viewed by other people.  This movie was a good introduction to my daily routine.  I had some problems with the writing, but I thought it was good.  It's a good movie for a young person to watch.  I have no problems with the sound.  I just wish they had used some audio or video capture techniques.  It was good to see some of the actors in the movie.  The acting was good, and the characters were believable"
Movies_and_TV_5,0,"After watching both dramas, I can say that the Taiwanese version is better than the Japanese version in all aspects.

First and foremost, the Japanese version seemed very cold. This version is much more light hearted (thanks to Jiro Wang, the music, and the overall set/clothing design) and has more ""romance"" parts than the Japanese version, which of course isn't anything spectacular seeing how most Asian dramas treat a simple kiss like the most shocking moment in history."

Kindle_Store_5,0,"Sports romance!! Woohoo!  A little different though since neither of them actually play! The quick of it...Okay so Jackson is a sports analyst and Leila...the new sideline sports reporter who's working under him. And oh the attraction and intrigue they have for each other! For the first time they've found someone who thinks like they do. It's numbers and stats and seeing how puzzles fit. One thing that won't fit? An office romance. *le sigh* And so a yummy battle of wills begins...

First up...Jackson. He's so yummy it's hard not to think naughty filthy things in his direction. Leila certainly had that trouble. And, well, he does too so double the fun for us! lol The connection between the two was great. I loved that they both have a thing for numbers and stats and think the same way.

Jackson's just flat out delicious. He's hot, sexy, at the top of his game, is a world class flirt and he's a good guy (sometimes he's a little too perfect) but he cares about people. I really loved the heroine too! She's a football junkie, a good person, hard worker and funny! I totally fell for her and her humor.

Their romance was slooooooow moving since they didn't want to risk her job at the network and whatnot but I loved that they became friends first and totally respected each other. But oh when it heated up! Oh, yeah! It seriously heated up. There were sweet and aw-worthy moments between them too that totally had me in a swoon. Oh, and he's got some growly alpha male in him too so it's not ALL sugary sweet...

Of course there was a little bit of relationship drama. I didn't totally buy into the reasoning behind it--it was a little shaky to me--but overall I was still on board.

*dreamy sigh* Jackson's Trust was a deliciously fluffy treat. A fun romance, wonderful friendships, humor, heat and plain ol likeable characters made for a delightful time."
Movies_and_TV_5,1,"This is an interesting movie.  It shows the long history of the U.S. and how we came to be the world's most powerful nation.  It shows how great it was that we came to be the world's most powerful nation.  This movie is excellent.

It is a very good movie.  I recommend it.I have been a fan of this series since I was a child. I love the show and the characters. I loved the fact that the series was written in the 80's and I have watched it over"
Kindle_Store_5,0,"Josh Anvil and the Pivotal Weapon by Bruce Arrington is a YA fantasy about the fourteen-year-old Josh and his heroic adventures outwitting the evil alien Raga and saving Earth from invasion.

Joshs human friend Troy accompanies him, along with Anton, a humanoid alien slave from another world. They meet up with more of Antons people, plus a helpful renegade alien, along the way.

This is the second adventure about Josh and his friends, and this time our hero has mind melded with an intelligent power that guides him into rescuing Antons son and a remarkable young woman who can split planets. Our hero pilots an organic spaceship made from a tree. It replicates Joshs favorite meals (fast food tacos and barbeque pizzas) and conjures cool teen clothes (jeans and t-shirts with snappy sayings).

Mixed in with the fun romp, the story examines more serious themes about Joshs loyalty, not only to his close friends, but also to the welfare of Earth. Our hero struggles with the consequences of rash and revengeful actions. The end of the story is a satisfying conclusion to the current set of adventures, and sets the stage for more fun to come in the sequel. For fans of YA fantasy adventures about a teenage boy, this story is a recommended read.

I purchased a copy of this book."

Pet_Supplies_5,0,"The very first time I put my dog's food in this dish he ate a couple bites then grabbed the bottom edge of the bowl and flipped it over to eat the food off the floor. Then (because it did not occur to me to put the bowl on a high shelf) he very quickly chewed all the rubbery non-skid stuff off the bottom of the bowl. He is not really a problem chewer so I think something about this bowl is just too appealing for dogs to resist eating the whole thing. I was just stupid to consider a plastic bowl as safe for a dog, but the pet company who made it is absolutely irresponsible."

The light output is nice and strong and the color temperature is cool. The size is good and the light output is excellent.

Electronics_5,0,"For us men with big fingers, hitting the keys on the tiny keypad on my iPhone is a huge challenge.  Also, I'm 56 and never learned to ""thumb type"".  Every time I type something, there's a mistake, and then a bizarre autocorrect, that can cause a LOT of embarrassment.  Yikes.

This keyboard is flawless.  It paired up instantly with my iPhone, and boom.  I was typing on my iPhone in by just pairing the device in Settings.  Yes, that easy.  It is charged via a USB port, so good to have one of those USB-to-electric adapters(which are super cheap).  Or you can charge it on any USB port anywhere.  Not exactly sure how long the charge holds for, as I never let it get to that point.  This device is combined with my iPhone to be charged overnight which works for my purposes (again, I'm 56)

It is VERY, VERY light.  It is is compact, as you can see from my pic, but still MUCH easier than the native iOS keyboard.  Plus the keyboard has a bunch of cool special features.  Why do I find out about great products like this so late?  I could have used this 5 years ago."

It was good, but it had some issues with me.  The main character was a bit too predictable.  I also did not like the ending.  It was not a good ending for the book.I was not disappointed.  I enjoyed reading this book and will be reading the next one soon.  I have been reading the series for about a month now and have enjoyed it so much.

Toys_and_Games_5,1,"There are obvious flaws. This is an easy way to make a child's imagination go wild.

I wish the game was more interactive.  The basic game is pretty simple, and that's what I like about it.  The pieces can be easily moved around, and you can also add a puzzle to a game to keep things interesting.  The pieces are a little challenging to get them all together, but I like the idea that they can be put together quickly and easily.

I'd also like to say that the game does come with a few small ""cards"" that you can play with.  These are used to create shapes"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,"I bought the black version and it is the best. I will keep this in the car and use it when I go hunting. The only negative is the plastic part. The plastic part is just a little hard to get on and off. I wish it was stronger.The pump does not work as well as I expected.  I have had to replace it with a new one.  I just went with the old pump.  The new pump works great.This is a great tool for camping or backpacking. The mount is very secure, and it is well built. This tool is super lightweight and easy to use. The mount is not too big, and it is easy to use. I would definitely recommend this to any camping friends or family.This is an awesome product and I was very impressed with the quality of the product. I'm happy with my purchase.Works great on my Trek saddle. I have the 4 wheel version of this saddle, and the saddle is a bit of a pain to get on, but it is a great product. I wear this saddle daily, and have not had any issues with it. I would recommend this saddle for anyone.This is a very nice bike.  I was looking for something that I could ride on, but I just didn't like the size.  The fact that it had a small wheel makes it very hard to ride, which is nice for a child.  It is very lightweight, and I would definitely recommend it for a beginner bike rider."

Pet_Supplies_5,1,I started giving this to my puppy and she loves it.  She also loves the taste and the other two have had no issues with it.  The only thing I would say is that it's a little pricey though.  I think it's going to be a little cheaper for the price.  I have a German Shepherd and I can't say it's a strong dog but she is very picky about toys
Electronics_5,1,"Hasn't broke down on me, but I am very pleased with it.

The only downside is that it's very small. I think it is the plastic part that is breaking down.

The only downside to this camera is that it's not very compact. If you have a large camera, it's a bit heavier, but if you have a small camera, you can take it everywhere.

Books_5,0,"I really liked reading this book because, while well translated, the French think differently, and the French thinking drove the book. I felt like Druon had researched well, and didn't dumb down history for his reader. He came up with motivation for his characters that seemed rational, considering the times, and he gives us a lot of context for understanding those times. It's a fascinating period in French history and a fascinating monarch, Philip IV."
Movies_and_TV_5,0,"If you like The Hobbit films, you owe it to yourself to get the Extended Edition.  Even though Steve Jackson did not give us as much extra material in the Hobbit films as he did in the Extended LOTR, the Extended Battle of Five Armies has substantially more material than the theatrical edition.  It also ties up some loose ends that exist in the theatrical film.  For people who like short, simple films, this entire series is too long.  For people who love Tolkien, and understand why a film cannot be the same as a book, it is too short.  Recommended."

The only thing I wish it had been a little bit better for is the battery life.  The battery life is about 8 hours, and it will charge the phone right up to the day of the trip.  It will charge the phone as long as you have the phone plugged in, so if you want to charge your phone before the trip, you can charge it for about an hour.  There is a small fan in the back that does the job, and you can turn it off if you want.  The fan does a good job of keeping the phone cool.  I have it hooked up to a computer, and the battery life is pretty good.  I will be buying another one.I really like the case.  It's a nice fit.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"I recently got this HTC Portamate PM1000 mobile base and a Delta 50-345.  The HTC comes with everything you need to assemble the base, while you have to provide your own hardwood for the Delta.  The HTC is adjustable to the nearest inch, making it a bit looser fit than the Delta (so, you still need some wood to shim your machine tight, or attach your tool to the stand).  I think the Delta would be harder to assemble if you didn't already have a drill press or some similar means of drilling a perfectly squared hole.  The rolling action of both is pretty comparable.  Overall, I'd probably choose this HTC over the Delta if I needed a third mobile base."

I did not know about the ending, but I was really impressed. I just watched the second season and I am so glad I did. It's very sad that they chose to make this one. The series has been going on since the early 90s, and the series has always been a hit with fans.

I think they could have made a lot more of the same plot and characters, but I don't think they could have made it as good as the first season. I would have loved to have seen the final season, but I think the ending was a little too much. The show is very well done, and the end of the first season was a very good one.

I showed him how it works and gave it to him again. He just looked at me and meowed. I haven't been able to get him to use them at all. If he wasn't a smart cat i could understand, but his very clever. He figured out that constantly pawing at my kitchen cabinets will get them to open so he can go inside. He also figured out that he can jump up and turn a door nob to get into closed rooms. I think he just doesn't like to play with balls. Go figure."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"I've had my eye on this beauty for a long time so when I finally found it at a reasonable price on Amazon I bought it. I have to say I absolutely love this piece. This is my sixth Tissot and has become my favorite. What stands out at first is it's stunning blue face. I can't help but stare at it just to take in all of its nuances. The bracelet has solid end links. It is a very comfortable to wear watch. Though it is a large case diameter, it ""wears"" very nicely. The bracelet is not clunky or heavy and is not cheap either. The chronograph pushers are screw in as is the crown. One thing that has impressed me thus far is its lume. It has a blueish lume that lasts throughout the night. The rotating bezel is solid and ratchets nicely. The sub second complication is also lumed which I find as a nice touch.
So far this chrono-diver has met my expectations and more. A must buy for any watch enthusiast."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"These curtains have been in my bedroom for over a month.
For the first week, I had them completely closed. What a difference from my summer curtains!! Absolutely NO light entered through them!
They blocked all of the ambient light: I almost thought that I had gone blind!
I usually wake up in the middle of the night for a quick run to the bathroom. But, with the curtains fully closed and no light at all, I had a rough time finding my way back to bed!!
Since I retired, I no longer keep a clock in the bedroom, and rely on the light coming in the windows to gauge the time of day.
So, after that first week, I was forced to leave the curtains open a tiny crack to let some daylight into the bedroom!
In addition, these curtains are a tremendous help in keeping out the cold winds that we suffer in the northeastern states.
The material feels very soft - almost like brushed microfiber, and is very true to the color shown. The side facing outside is white.
In every respect, I am totally satisfied with the material and performance of these curtains."

I did get a free item and it is a great gift. We love this set. It's a great kit. I like that the pieces are interchangeable so it's easy to learn how to assemble. I love that it comes with two small pieces that each come with a lid. This allows you to assemble the pieces as you wish. The pieces come in two different sizes, so I don't have to worry about them getting lost. I was able to find some pieces that are small enough to fit in a plastic bag. I love that the pieces are not glued together so they don't fall out. The pieces are sturdy and look just like the picture. The price was good and it's a great set. I would definitely recommend this. My daughter loves it and was very happy with this. I would have given it 5 stars but it was a nice price for what it is.

Amazon even sells a device to bolt onto the gun to mitigate 'barrel-droop' so this must be a real issue. Reviews of other manufacturers' guns do not mention 'barrel-droop' so I can only conclude that RWS has an issue other manufacturers do not.

But if this is such a great gun, why does one have to purchase an extra device to mitigate what appears to me to be either a design issue or a manufacturing defect?  I would love to hear a real explanation from an expert.  Until then, I will postpone any purchase decision.

I loved this book! It was a great read.  I had a lot of fun with the characters and the storyline.  This book had a lot of fun in it's own way.  This book is a great series for adults and teens.  I look forward to reading more books by this author.

I love how the heroine is able to overcome her fears to make her relationship work. This is a fun story and I recommend it.I loved this book. It was very good and I'm happy to see that it's ending. I'm not a big fan of endings in books. I like the hero and heroine but not the heroine. I just liked the way the story was written. I'll be reading the next one in the series.Great book.

Electronics_5,1,"After 2 months of searching, I finally found the third one.  This one is a bit older and more expensive.  I am using it with the TRS-80 and it does not have a hard drive in it.  The drive is not very compact and it has not been able to hold up with the current typing.  I have the TRS-80 on the left and the TRS-80 on the right and they are both very close to each other.  The drive is also very loud and seems to be very portable.  The TRS-80 has a magnetic feature and the TRS-80 has a feature on the left that makes it easier to use the keyboard.  I have not tried it with the TRS-80 and I have no idea what they have in store for it.

It is a nice size and well made.  I would not hesitate to buy this again if I could.  It has a lot of features and it is very well made.

I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a portable keyboard for typing on a computer.

Over exaggerated acting of annoying female and nonplussed male. Stereotypes en masse. Acting for the camera - acting. 5.

Books_5,0,"The mystery in this book was as decent and solid as any in the series, but I found it overshadowed by Hamish's bizarre decisions when it came to women.  Granted, he's never been particularly successful, but at this point it's been drawn out so far it's becoming painful.  In this case a part of it was necessary to the plot, but it still had me cringing to read it.

I think this is the part of Hamish's personality that I have difficulty pinning down, despite having read most of the books in the series.  Perhaps watching the BBC television series further muddled the waters, because the character there was slightly different than the man I envisioned through reading the books.  His attitude towards women and relationships seems slightly off (not in any bad way, but in a 'sometimes old fashioned' and 'sometimes suddenly very modern' way) and it throws the character out of balance.  In truth, I'd prefer the series much more if the love life aspect was dropped more by the wayside.  There have been some books where it was merely an aside mentioned, and I wish more were that way.  Because the series has gone on for so long, and we've gotten to know some of the characters so well, it's in danger of slipping more into a soap opera than a set of neat, tidy little mysteries.

Compared to some of the other books in the series, this one was a little lacking.  However, compared to a lot of other mystery series, it was still fairly decent.  I'd say dedicated fans of the series should definitely read it, but newcomers really should start at the beginning to really understand the dynamics of the relationships.

AUDIOBOOK NOTE:  The audiobooks in the series have all been spectacularly done, and this is no exception.  The accents and voices are top-notch, the reading style is smooth and easy to listen to.  Highly recommended as an audiobook."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"Great stove. Easy to clean (when needed). Easy to maintain in the field. Parts are plentiful everywhere in the world. This stove will burn just about any fuel you want to put into it, though I don't suggest kerosene or gasoline. I bought this stove and used it faithfully for 20 years. I updated my stove recently to a Snow Peak Giga-Power with auto-ignite. Despite loving my new stove very much, I keep this stove and still use it from time to time on cold day hikes to boil water for tea. It has NEVER failed me in over 20 years no matter what I put it through.

If you are looking for lightweight backpacking stove and you may be traveling with a few people or overseas this may be a great choice for you.

If you want less weight and don't mind a slightly longer boil time (per qt), go with the Giga-Power with auto ignite by Snow Peak. The fuel canisters are readily available at most backpacking stores or online. I can boil water for tea (for myself) and all 3 meals for 3 full days and nights on one of the small canisters (8oz. or so) in moderate to fair weather. They weigh less than the liquid fuel+bottle you would be carrying with the MSR Whisperlite. Still a great stove hence the 5 star rating."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"These fit comfortably, no binding or anything anywhere, form fitting but not tight when sitting or bending.

The side pockets without buttons are handy, I like the slid in slot for a cell phone, but the rest of the pockets are mostly useless for me.  The front pockets are deeper than I'd prefer, and I've never been a fan of buttons on pockets.  The buttons on the back I just leave unbuttoned, since I only have a wallet I put back there, and the main pockets on the sides of the shorts I don't even use, just the smaller pockets for the cell phone.

The other downside is that the material is just a little too light for my taste.  I haven't had any issues with these, but I had a similar pair and last summer simply bumping against the rounded handle of my lawnmower's plastic push control was enough to split them in front of the pocket, not even in a seam, but in the middle of a panel.  These are a light, thin material like those were, so I'm going to be extra careful since I would prefer something a little more sturdy.

The color was rather darker than the picture showed as well - I like it, but if you're looking for something on the tanner side of the spectrum, these aren't the shorts you're looking for.

Belt is pretty much for display purposes only, I've never been a fan of this type of buckle.

They fit well though, and are comfortable.  I wish the material was a little thicker, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and stick with four stars as long as they hold out."

Kindle_Store_5,0,"One Funeral continues on right where No Weddings ends. This time it's in Hannah's point of view. It takes you through Hannah's journey of getting through the pain of what her ex had done to her in the past and re-starts the build up of her relationship with Cade.
I tend to not read stories that about ongoing relationships, but something about how this story is written makes me want to hurry up and keep reading to see how it ends. I thought the authors did a tremendous job of completely creating two entirely different characters in Hannah and Cade. Having this story in Hannah's perspective, you feel her vulnerability as she moves through the story, something you don't really get in the first book as Cade doesn't really see her vulnerable side. This entire series is much like the characters' relationship, a nice slow burn that allows the relationship to build in a lasting way.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"I bought these shoes for a dual purpose.  I need a good sturdy boot to work around my horse farm.  I also needed a strong shoe that is fit to ride in, so when chores are done, I can just jump on one of my horses without going into the house to change.  In addition, I'm taking a sightseeing trip this summer and will be on my feet at least 12 hours a day.  These boots completely fit the bill.

They are attractive enough that they look great with jeans or khakis.  They look especially cute with white socks and walking shorts.  They are not too clunky, they look like brown sneakers/shoes.  They were so comfy from the moment I put them on, that no breaking in period was required.  I stomped through the mud and water and my socks stayed nice and dry.  I worked outside for a good 12 hours, the first time I put them on, and when I got in the house, I felt good, my back, knees and feet felt just fine, all of which I have trouble with.  They are true to size.  I will replace them with another pair when they wear out.  Money well spent.  I recommend them highly.  I'll buy another pair if I find them in black.

I also work in an office full time and I wore them to work with khakis and they looked fine."

Books_5,0,"J.D. Robb, aka Nora Roberts, does a great job with the In Death series. I've read all of them, some of them multiple times. Her latest effort is somewhat formulistic -- a case long closed suddenly opens up again when a prisoner who she helped to put away escapes and comes looking for her. What makes this different is the link to her mother. I think she missed an opportunity by killing her mother off. I've been wondering about grandparents, aunts, uncles, etc. While there are a few tidbits about the mother's early life -- there's nothing there that really rounds her out as a person. I would much rather have had the mother escape, and show up in later works, giving Dallas a chance to explore more of her past. As it is, I think Robb made a mistake on this one."
Toys_and_Games_5,0,"This is a really menacing figure, as befits the guard dog of the underworld of Hades. It's a sturdy figure, but may not be that suitable for smaller children due to the rough edges and fairly sharp detail on the figure.

What I got it for was for use in roleplaying games. The figures for those games, of which D&D is a great example, are usually of the 25/28mm or 1/72 scale. In that scale, this figure is huge, the size of a bus. For some reason, that's how I've always pictured Cerberus, so it works for me. If you're looking for something more the size of a large dog, then this won't be for you. Otherwise, it will surely have players breaking into a nervous sweat when it's brought to the gaming table.

The sculpt is dynamic and properly fierce looking, and it stands well on its own. The paint scheme is simple but very well-done. Overall, a very good figure for those interested in Greek mythology."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"I'm only using 4 stars for now, but will update after I use it snow skiing [intended use] in a few weeks.  I was looking for a ""practical"" clip-on watch that I could use snow skiing, to attach to an external zipper pull [so I could check the time without having to mess with my jacket sleeve].  My husband ordered it for me.  Took it on a trial run biking the other day and had it clipped to my vest pocket zipper pull.  SO FAR, I LIKE IT!  It's just a tad larger [diameter] than I would like, but it's light-weight, not bulky, and lies flat.  My biggest fear was that the numbers would be hard to see [old-lady eyes], but I could read it just fine even looking through sunglasses.  The only issue was with the little seal ring -- it took some patience to get it re-seated.  Also, I replaced the standard carabiner that comes with it -- I prefer the small, ""S"" carabiners.  I'll update this review after I ski with it.

Edit:  OK, so 5 stars.  It worked great as a time-piece/zipper pull for skiing!  The size was an advantage as I could easily grab it with ski gloves on.  Sometimes a button would get pushed accidently which put it in another mode, but easily fixed -- had to take ski gloves off, though, to fix it as they were too bulky to use for pushing buttons.  No problems at all with the low temps.  Good visibility.  Sorry, but I didn't use any of the other functions -- was only interested in the watch."

The wax formula used in these is not very good, and it doesn't take much shaking for it to diffuse into the water, making it so cloudy you can't see the wax blob at all.  It's pretty much a guarantee that it's going to be shaken during shipping and that you'll receive junk.

Upon contacting the manufacturer, they offered to send replacements over and over again, but no one would address the real problem:  Isn't something wrong with the product if you can't even ship it without it being destroyed?

For those stuck with these lamps, here is one DIY solution:  When the lamp is cold, very gently open the bottle cap on top with a tiny flat-head screw driver.  Loosen the teeth of the cap all the way around just enough to get the cap off.  Do not use a bottle opener, because it will bend the cap in the middle and you'll never get it to seal tightly again.

Books_5,0,"Romantic suspense is at its very best with this latest read from Ms. Wainscott. Wrapped up in one terrific package is a rampant serial killer, a controlling husband, a beaten-down wife, and a handsome mysterious loner all connected in this intricate and suspenseful plot.
With the reappearance of ""Spooky Silas"" Koole, Katie is reminded of the girl she used to be before she married local vet and her savior, Ben Ferguson. After her mother died, Katie lived with another family and was befriended by Ben who had aided her when Gary, the bully, injured her kitten. Now, after nine years of marriage, Katie is but a shell of her former self, complacent and pleasing, no longer the spirited girl Silas remembered.
Even as Silas warns Katie to trust no one, the serial killer strikes again, leaving no body, and Silas is the main suspect. And fear strikes Katie, as the list of possible suspects cleverly emerges: Is it Gary, the kitten abuser and gruff cop, Harold, the creepy ""art"" dealer, Silas, who empathetically feels the killer, or Ben, the town hero and control freak husband?
As love emerges between loner Silas and a damaged Katie, it becomes so much more than just romance, mainly a culmination of life-long love deepening into mature adult love. As they begin to trust one another, Katie is forced to question her marriage, her mother's death years before, and her life, as she has known it for the last nine years.
Ms. Wainscott's latest is a masterpiece of mystery, chock full of suspense, and brimming with romantic attraction. Readers unfamiliar with this rising star's work will definitely want to check out this latest suspenseful novel."
Movies_and_TV_5,0,"For SyFy, this isn't worse than anyother tripe they put out. It's got Ving Rhames and Lesley-Ann Brandt is pretty kickass. With one exception, the cast is actually pretty good. Which leads us to-Taryn Manning. She has to be the WORST actress in the history of zombie films. She can't act her way out of a paperbag. Her character, Romona was also the most useless character I have ever seen in a movie. She gives ""too stupid to live"" a whole new meaning. Her friend is being murdered, what does she do? RUN AWAY and yell at everyone else because they didn't save him! The special effects are sub-par, but I kind of expected that. There were a few major errors that would have been cheap and made things look more realistic, but they producers were obviously too lazy to figure out. For instance Henry kills a zombie with a chainsaw, then right after he stands there holding the chainsaw and you can clearly see THERE IS NO CHAIN on it! How hard would have been to use a fake prop chain or put a chain on after the ""kill"". The film moves along fine until the end and SPOILER alert: there are not one but TWO freaky, fake as f@!& looking zombie tigers at the dock. It was like they didn't know how to end the movie, so they just started throwing crap out there to see what would stick."

That being said - I often find my self simply skip 2-5 pages without reading in this book, GOD his tells this story slow and very ""proud of his country"" like. This book is Clancy at his slowest - and that is sad since this is one of his better plots in my opinion. Wasted in all his rhetoric."
Toys_and_Games_5,0,"Super plush item. Really adorable. Great size -- not too big, not too small. I bought it for myself and I am very pleased. Retails for $4.99 at Ikea, so if you are in close proximity to Ikea, you may be better off going there.  I don't live that close to an Ikea, so I paid the additional money and awaited delivery.  Item arrived from Germany pretty quickly, so that is also a plus."

She was a little freaked out by the fact that it was made of plastic.  The box is a bit big for a cat and it's pretty big for a dog.  I'd rather have a bigger box with a cat litter box and a dog box with a litter box.  The box is very light weight and the cats are very happy with it.  I think it's a great addition to their litter box.  They'll enjoy it too.This is a very good dog food. I have three dogs, two of whom are tall, and one of them has had a few issues with the"

The story was well told and kept me engaged.I absolutely loved this book! I was given this book by a friend in exchange for an honest review.  I loved it!  I really love this series.  This author has a way of weaving a story that keeps you guessing and interested.  I highly recommend this book.  I have been hooked from the first page.  I read this series from beginning to end.  This book was a roller coaster of emotions that kept me on the edge of my seat and was a wonderful read.  This story was told from an emotional standpoint and I was able to see how the characters affected"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"Best machine for the money! This is our second Magnifica Super Automatic.  Our previous machine finally stopped being perfect after eight years of daily use (usually three or four uses per day).  The amount of money this machine has saved us over the past eight years is astonishing.  I prefer my homemade lattes to coffee shop lattes by a long shot.  Our guests always remember how fabulous our coffee is and request it if we don't offer!

It is absolutely super automatic.  You do have to clean it and add water after five or six double shots, but it is simple to do so.  You have to dump out the grinds from an easily removed container, pour out the excess water in the drip pan and fill up the water reservoir.  It usually takes about three minutes, tops, to complete this.  Once per month I gently wipe down the interior with a damp cloth and remove the grinder for a more thorough clean.  That process is about 5 minutes to complete.  The descaling happens once every four months or so (we have soft water so it doesn't get a lot of scale build up) and takes less than 30 minutes for the machine to do its thing.  Other than that, you just add beans and enjoy fabulous coffee.  Simple!  Simple!  Simple!

I was delighted that DeLonghi offered virtually the same machine now as it did eight years ago.  If it isn't broken, don't fix it!  We unpacked the box, followed the brief set up instructions and within 15 minutes were enjoying an excellent latte.

I can't recommend this machine enough for coffee lovers. It makes the best espresso shots anywhere (we love Lavazza espresso http://www.amazon.com/Lavazza-Super-Espresso-Coffee-2-2-Pound/dp/B000SDKDM4/ref=sr_1_2?s=home-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1419869268&sr=1-2&keywords=lavazza+expresso), is easy to use and clean, and is a fabulous value.  You won't want to buy a latte at a coffee shop again."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"I have 4 of these in my bathroom and they look great. I use them for very heavy items ranging from oversize wet bath towels to kids bath toys. They fit in the decor really well without having to go and install unsightly bath hooks that require drilling into the wall. They are the perfect size for what I need and very easy to install. I haven't had to remove them yet, however they are stuck to tile so I'm not sure how the removable feature works but so far they have held up in the humidity of my bathroom very well. I would recommend these to my friends and family who might be looking for great hooks that hold up very well.

I received this item for free or at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion and unbiased review."
Kindle_Store_5,0,"I love Howey's work!  Sometimes it makes me incredibly happy about being human while at other times, his words make me fell ashamed of humanity itself.

Definitely not but it was never given the chance to live and learn. Sad."
Toys_and_Games_5,0,"Can you say happy little girl!! My 10 year old is over the moon with this house. It was pretty easy to put together, took maybe 30 minutes. It is huge but light so she can move it out from the wall during playtime and back when she is finished. She and her friends can both play with this because it is a two sided house with rooms on both sides. Fits Monster High furniture with room to spare but she also really loves the furniture it comes with. My only slight annoyance is if we want to change the floor plan it will be a very large pain. But I let her pick her favorite from the floor plans and we will be sticking to it and she is still tickled with it. Best gift of Christmas. Awesome price and shipping but ships in its box so just hope it arrives while the kids are at school."

I did get a medium, but it is a little longer than I expected."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"After searching many websites for vacuums I was more than confused.  Attempting to get reviews that I felt comfortable with led me to Amazon.  All I can say is that every positive review on here was correct.  This Dirt Devil packs a great punch for the money.  It is extremely light weight and versatile, the carrying strap makes it even more so.  It fits under furniture that my canister does not.  It is great for autos, steps, and bare floors, which is what i wanted; I use my canister for the wall to wall.  It is easy to empty the dirt container and because it is clear, it is easy to see when it is full. The cord is also long enough for me to do an entire room and with the strap attached, I just walk and vac.  My cleaning time has been cut in half with this unit and I highly recommend it to everyone."

The shirt is a little tight on my chest so it will be fine if I don't wear it for a long time. I love the color and the fit. It is a little heavier than I expected but I will keep it. I am 5'6"" and 115 pounds so I ordered a medium and it fits fine. The material is nice and warm. I am usually a size 6, but ordered a medium. The shirt is a little stiff and it feels a little tight around my body. I am 5'2"" and 130 pounds so I ordered a medium and it fit fine. It is very comfortable and I'm happy with my purchase. I love the color and the fit. I will order a few more colors. I really like these jeans. They fit well and are comfortable. They are a little large for me so I would prefer to have a medium. They are a little longer than I was hoping but not too long either. They are very comfortable. I would recommend these jeans. I ordered this for my daughter. She is a small girl and it fit perfect. The length is perfect and the color is beautiful. She loves it and wears it everyday. Very comfortable. I am a 36D and ordered a medium. It fits perfectly. Very comfortable."

Very suspenseful..  You think you have it figured out and then you don't.  I recommend it to anyone who likes suspense.  Not exactly John Grisham, but I still enjoyed it."

Electronics_5,1,"Sadly I can't compare it to a professional camera, which is a lot more expensive.

The other two cameras I've tried, both have excellent sound and are easily adjustable.

The only downside is the battery life, which is about the same as an average DSLR.

I'm not a pro photographer and I'm not sure if it would be worth it to take a lot of shots with it, but it is nice to have an external camera, so I don't have to worry about losing the battery.

The only downside is that the battery life is a little short, but it is still usable.

Overall, I'm very pleased with the camera and recommend it to anyone looking to get professional DSLR photography.

Kindle_Store_5,0,"This book is different from any story I ever read. While it starts as a regular suspense, it soon turns into a grabbing thriller where the emotion and suspense escalate with every page. I had trouble putting it down as I followed the tribulations of the heroine Dorrie. Morgan Mandel does a great job at keeping us turning the pages as we discover Dorrie's problems and wonder how she will react. The villains are great too, each with a convincing motivation to explain their actions. This is the first book in a series and we can't wait for the others."

Electronics_5,1,"Finally seem to have found a better balance with the sound of the G-7. If you have an older iPod, you may want to get the TRS-80. I bought this to replace an older Kindle Fire HD which came with an older Kindle Fire HD. The Kindle Fire HD is great for taking the phone and tablet out of the pocket to carry around. I love the fact that the Kindle Fire HD is an on/off switch that allows you to switch from the Kindle Fire HD to the Kindle Fire HD. I'm not sure why the switch was a little longer than expected but it worked great for me. I can't say enough about the sound quality of the Kindle Fire HD. It's amazing how well the sound is reproducing the sound of the Kindle Fire HD. It's not the best but I'm glad I got it. I recommend this to anyone who wants to try and get a good sound quality. Great buy. Works great. Only thing is the ear pads are a little stiff, so you need to use a tiny screwdriver to make them firm. The size of these is perfect. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good earbud. I would recommend this product to anyone looking to use their iPad for music."

I'm very pleased with the quality and look of the boots.I love it.I bought this for my husband for his birthday.  He's a huge fan of the sneaker and it fits perfectly.  He's tall and has a narrow foot, so it's nice to have an extra size in the shoe.  He is 5'10"", so it's really nice to have it in the size he prefers.  The shoe is a little narrow at the toe, but not too big.  It's a nice pair of shoes to have to wear for work or to wear when walking around the house.  It's also a little hard to find in the stores, so if you're looking for something that's really well made, this might be a good choice.  It's a good buy.  He's going to order another pair soon.

Pet_Supplies_5,1,"Our Maine Coons & picky eaters love these!  I will keep them for a long time. I bought this for a friend who has a small dog and she had a very sensitive ear. She had no issues with it, which was great. This was recommended to me by her veterinarian and it's great for her to keep ear clean and be able to adjust her ear to the noise level. It does make her nervous as it is on a sensitive ear. This product works great on my dogs ears. I have a 50# Rottweiler with a sensitive ear. This has helped immensely. I have used it on both dogs. We have a rescue dog and I use this on them both. I can't say enough about this product. My dog was able to tolerate it for a very long time. I would recommend this to anyone who has a sensitive ear. I have a dog who is a rough chewer. She is a 5 pound dog and this is the only product she will eat. She loves it. It's very strong and she doesn't seem to mind the smell of it. She also doesn't mind having it on all the time. She likes the taste, but it's not a great treat for her."

Books_5,0,"TRUNK MUSIC is the fifth Harry Bosch detective novel and may be the best of the series so far. Mr. Connelly writes sharp dialogue and page-turning narrative. Beyond writing mechanics, the creation of hard-boiled detective Bosch is what makes the series so interesting. Because Harry Bosch is so interesting. Set in LA and Las Vegas, TRUNK MUSIC gets the reader involved in Hollywood slease, police corruption and mob antics on the way to solving the murder of a man left in the trunk of his car (hence ""trunk music""). I am getting a bit tired with Harry Bosch getting in trouble with his police bosses and IAD (Internal Affairs Division) and his fellow detectives suspecting him of being a rogue cop. I mean, Harry has solved many murders brilliantly and, by now, they should be trusting him more. So it seems a little unrealistic that they still come down hard on him for doing his job. Perhaps Mr. Connelly will see the logical flaw in the plot there and correct that with different plot complications and tensions in future Harry Bosch books. I don't know but maybe I'll find out in the sixth Harry Bosch story, ANGELS FLIGHT. Such nit-picking aside, TRUNK MUSIC is music to my ears."

I only received 1 lanyard but it's ok; I didn't contact them to send another.  For me at 7-bucks they're thrown in the drawer and my iHome pen is clipped in my Venue Pro case.  They're built well but just don't work great on any of the 4 tablet devices I have, eh?  Get 'em if you've tried a friends on your device and they work.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"These are cute and colorful silicone reusable cupcake molds. They will make a smaller than normal cupcake which is fine by me but may not be for everyone.  I found that if you fill the molds half way or more the final resulting cupcake doesn't much resemble a butterfly. If you only fill the molds about the third of the way the finished product will be smaller but will look like a butterfly especially when frosted and decorated.

These molds don't each hold the same shape.  They are fairly thin and do distort easily. They are a bit of work to clean.  My brand new dishwasher didn't get them completely clean so I suggest you wash them by hand, which can be a chore.  I will definitely use these again but not as often as I thought I would.

Kindle_Store_5,0,"Such a fantastic story! Accidental Alpha is the third book in Laurel's A is for Alpha Male series and I completely adored it! It was such a fun, quirky yet emotional read. Allison is back from her road trip with Hayley and learns some not so great new. I completely adored Wade too. He's so funny. I highly recommend and can't wait for the next in the series."
Kindle_Store_5,1,"I thought I liked Colt...but I'm glad I didn't.

The story starts out with Colt and two friends, Nick and Riley. Nick is the head of the sports team and Riley is the assistant coach. Nick is a strong, determined man. This is a fun story. I love a fast paced story. I found it difficult to put the story down once I started reading. I just didn't want to put the book down.

I loved the way the story went about getting Colt to be a good husband. I liked how he ended up with his kids. I enjoyed the way it ended. I really liked the way it ended. I'm glad I did.

I would definitely recommend this book to anyone. It's a fun story and I'll be reading more of it.This is a very good story with good characters. I wish it had been longer.  It was not a bad book but I"

Kindle_Store_5,1,"Never a dull moment in this book, with the twists and turns. The author has a way with words. The reader will not want to put down until the very end. The story is well told and will keep you turning the pages. This book is a must read for anyone who likes to read with a smile on their face. I received a copy of this book for my honest opinion. This book was great! The characters were all well written and the story line was very interesting. I hope the next book will be a little better!I received this book in exchange for an honest review. This was a good read. I enjoyed reading about the town of Tysons and the people who lived there. There were some things that I found a little repetitive, but overall a good read."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"i received this knife after some mishandling during shipping, it appears the original one was lost or stolen...but I digress. now on to the knife itself, when I opened the package I wasn't expecting very much but I was surprised to find a really good quality blade that wasn't chrome but a matt silver which is fine for me. the edge was very sharp out of the box and the case seemed to lock onto the blade securely. ive heard that you get what you pay for...but this knife is a great value for the low price."

Kindle_Store_5,1,I was entertained by this book. The characters were well developed and kept my interest.
Electronics_5,0,wow...came quick!!!!!!!...eagle called and shipped it next day from tampa to st pete...guys were as professional as you can expect from truck drivers and they helped me scoot it into my garage...i love amazon because they are extremely competitive with pricing...i don't know how they can afford to stay in busines...as for why i chose the top end model when i could have saved 50 bucks on the HPT4254...this model is sleeker looking...thanks amazon for delivering one of the best plasmas on the market at a very affordable price...oh and why did i choose samsung over panasonic...the panny bast model did not offer a vga connection for my laptop...
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,Nice looking and not too hard to construct...but made out of very FLIMSY particleboard and CHEAP inferior material... the veneer was soooo thin that it is almost not there... there were many chinks and damaged surfaces in the top piece and the whole thing is just not good quality.

Pet_Supplies_5,0,"Piper, my Corgi puppy absolutely loves this toy! It just gives her everything she loves in one toy. It squeaks (there are 16 squeakers, 8 on each side, running down the whole 'gator body!), it rattles (the head part rattles when you shake it), and it's fabulous for playing tug-of-war.

We often play with this toy together, but it's her go-to toy when she's playing alone too. Another plus is how really well made this toy is. She is pretty rough on this toy, and even after four weeks of daily play, it's held up beautifully. No rip, tears or holes despite her best efforts! lol

I highly recommend this toy and so does Piper!!!!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"It works as a lift but not as I wanted it for which was to be able to place a dish under it and cook in two dishes at once in my pressure cooker. The legs are no where as long as in the image. Not sure if the product was changed from original images, but the legs are not tall at all.

That said, it is sturdy and works so we are keeping it"

Books_5,0,"Just didn't hold my interest. I finished it, but it was really a disappointing read."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"I bought this for my mom, who has arthritis in her fingers and was having a lot of difficulty opening her wine bottles.  My parents have only been using it for 2 weeks now, but so far it's working very well.

There is a red LED at the top that indicates when it is charging.  Both of my parents expected this light to turn green or turn off when it was done charging, and for the first day were both concerned that the fact that it stayed red meant that it was not charging properly (and therefore would not work).  The light never turns off though, and it never changes color.. all it does is indicate when it is getting power.  I'm not sure how descriptive the manual is about this.

Also, it took a few times for my mom to realize that she doesn't have to push down on it while opening the wine bottle.  No need to press down at all.  It does require you to hold the bottle still, or else it spins the entire bottle, but you don't have to press down at all.  You just press the button and it does all the work for you.

I don't know if it will continue to work as it does right now, but if it doesn't then I'll modify my review.  So far, it's working exactly as I had hoped.

UPDATE: November 2013:
My parents still continue to use this electric wine bottle opener.  Occasionally they have some trouble getting the cork to come off the corkscrew, and since the corkscrew is sharp (as it is supposed to be), they have to be careful getting it off (my dad cut his finger on it once, but has been more careful since then).  Most of the time there is no issue.  It has definitely exceeded my expectations!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"We use this with our toddler as a ""learning tower."" It is the perfect height for her to stand on and reach the kitchen counter. She is 2.5, so she have the motor ability and skill level to stay up on this step stool and help when we cook or do things in the kitchen. I also use this around the house as a regular step stool. We have a small kitchen, so I like that I can fold this and keep it out of the way. A large wooden learning tower would not work well for our space at all. This definitely wouldn't work with a younger baby as a learning tower. Use your judgment. You know your child and their ability to stand on a stool without falling.. if you decide to use this as a learning tower too."

Books_5,0,"Having been involved in state and local government as an elected official, I was particularly interested in her journey from local government observer then participant and her subsequent rise to state wide and then national involvement. That's a hard, tough row to hoe, as anyone who has butted heads with the entrenched bureaucracies of lifelong civil servants knows. They think they own the government and that elected folks are just a temporary irritant. Sarah never gave up and beat them at their own game and is a shining example to those who actually serve instead of sitting on the sidelines."

Electronics_5,1,"I really debated between 2 of these, as they both fit nicely on my iPad mini. The other two fit very well. I also like the fact that the micro USB connector is just a little longer. The size of the adapter is nice and compact. The charger is also a bit smaller than I expected. I can use the mini with a USB charger in it for charging or charging with my iPad. The only reason I gave it 5 stars is that it's small enough to be easy to carry around, but I'm not sure that I would want to carry it around with me. Also, the cord is kind of stiff, but it's not bad. Overall, this is a great product for the money. I purchased this for my nephew's laptop and it works great."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"Works okay. The pistol is very hard to cock. The rifle shootsway off sights and there is no way to make it more accurate. I have woodpeckers that decide to take up residence from time to time. It is close enough to frighten them, but not close enough to hit one for a lasting lesson. They are usually about 60 feet away, so this is some serious inaccuracy."

Pet_Supplies_5,0,"This is impossible to keep clean.  I empty the water completely and refill daily, and I take the stupid thing apart and clean it thoroughly weekly, but it still gets slimy and icky.  Taking it apart and cleaning should be simple and straightforward.  They are not.  Even with sponges, bottle brushes and toothpicks, there are still crevices that stubbornly hold on to the goobies that end up in my cats water.  Taking the motor apart is a huge pain, and I didn't even know I was supposed to do that until I dropped the unit while cleaning, and the lever that is supposed to control the water flow (that, in fact, does nothing) broke off.  I looked inside the motor and found slimy cat hairs and a goobie the size of marbles stuck inside!  You shouldn't have to break something to figure out you need to clean it.  I had been scrubbing the motor's plastic grating with an old toothbrush, but that wasn't enough work I guess.

My cats love it, but I will never purchase another one. I'll find a bubbly fountain that provides safe and clean water to the cats without driving the humans crazy!"

Books_5,0,"After a long long time I got to read something so fulfilling. Something that one can identify with instantly and it does not take much effort as well. The theme of Brother Vs. Brother is universal and appealing to all. Maybe because as children of Cain, we are all the same - A blend of Good and Bad. Wow!!
East of Eden was heavy for me!!
Steinbeck is so good at descriptions - love the style of writing, the dry subtle humor- the very fact that he does not justify his character's actions - the struggle of mankind, the inner conflict,is so beautifully portrayed.
The Theme: Brother vs. Brother
The Plot:  Two Families in Salinas, California. The Trasks and the Hamiltons. Adam Trask who faces a life-long complex from his brother Charles Trask heads towards a new life - with his brand-new wife. The birth of his twins is a joyous moment only to result in a sad one - with Kathy (his wife) walking out on
him.
He raises the kids with his manservant Lee - the ever symbolical of what is right - Chinese - who is a great human character in ages to come.
The twins - Aron and Cal are poles apart and the rest is as they say ""History"".
The Hamiltons are a different breed altogether. Nine children and Samuel Hamilton is a man who never feels the need to have more money.
I guess the Biblical influence is immense in the book - but obvious it had to be!!
Overall, a great great awesome read!!"
Kindle_Store_5,0,It was nice to read something with action from a woman's point of view.  A great deal of humor as well. I thoroughly enjoyed the book.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,Work like a charm. Very bright and light weight. The rubber stretches enough to fit the under seat tubing. It has 3 modes which are easy to change through. They have a backing which has a good tilt to them which allows the light to be visible properly.
Movies_and_TV_5,0,"Highlights: Terrifying scenes of suspense and building of tension; immaculate cinematography depicting lifeless England; most of the performances, principally lead Cillian Murphy's and the reliable Brendan Gleeson's; alternative ending is KILLER.
Lowpoints: Too much zombies, too little subliminal terror at times; Megan Burns as the little girl is a truly terrible performance that fortuitously doesn't bring the film down.
Conclusion: An unflinching, metaphorical look at the possible loss of control over rage amongst humans, 28 Days Later marks Danny Boyle's comeback from his flop The Beach. Petrifying with its realism and astounding in its contrastive moods, 28 Days Later definitely has more in common with the director's dark masterpiece Trainspotting - it is scary, droll and compelling, and will linger with its audience, despite its flaws, long after the ending.

Toys_and_Games_5,1,"This is really a fantastic starter set, with lots of variety in the elements. I would recommend this set.My grandson is 9 months old and loves the game, so he enjoys it so much.  It's a good size for him.  My son is still very young for the game, but he's enjoying it so much that he'll enjoy it with us as well.  I just wish there were more buttons to go on.  I like that the game is easy to learn.  My son is going to enjoy this game, but he won't really enjoy it very much.  I would say this is a good buy for the price.My son is a big fan of Legos and this set does exactly what he wants.  It comes with a lot of Legos and it's sturdy enough to keep him entertained for a while.  The set is pretty small, but not too small that it would be difficult to fit in the palm of his hand.  He's going to love it.  The price is right and it's a great set for the price.

Toys_and_Games_5,0,"We have fun with this game--but the holes the objects are placed into seem to be bigger than in the set I had as a kid, so it's not as challenging. My kid gets bored a lot faster than I used to."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,"I hesitated in spending the money on the quality, but I did. This is a nice one. I bought this for a friend, and she is a very tall woman. She is very happy with it. It is very comfortable, and it is light weight. I am very pleased with the design. I have a large family, and the fact that it is a little heavier than I expected is great. I have a few items that I am returning, but I am not sure if it is worth it for the price. I will probably order another one. I have a friend who has a lot of work to do on it, and she loves it! I am very pleased with this product. Very nice to have them for those times when you don't want to have to wash them all the time. I have used them for about a month now and still love them. I have not washed them yet, but I will. I will probably buy a couple of more of these at a later date. I have been using this for a few months now and I have used it more than once to create a new outdoor cafe/fiesta. It is very sturdy and easy to assemble. It is also easy to clean. I have not had a problem with the coffee tasting bad, but I do wish there was a way to protect it from the elements and not ruin it. The quality is good and the colors are wonderful. I am very happy with it. Works great, but not as good as I expected. I have been using it for a few months now and it is still holding up well. So I will keep it."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"Great training tool for my little puppy. She learned to walk really well with this. Only drawback is that it chafed her armpit if she pulled more. Also, would be better if the clasps were up higher rather than at the armpit. This also is what chafed her."
Kindle_Store_5,1,What a great read. I loved it and am looking forward to reading more from this author. I received an ARC in exchange for an honest review. I love this book. The characters are well written and the story is a bit predictable. This is a great series for young adults. I have read the first book in the series and am looking forward to reading the next one. This book has a lot of action and danger. It's very realistic.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,"Since the first infomercial I saw, I thought it was a great product, but I was wrong.

I had a friend who was a lifetime member of the DIY community and wanted to go to a home improvement store to try out this one. This was an excellent product and I knew I was in the right place at the right time.

I bought a new light bulb and installed it in my new apartment.  I'm very pleased with it.

The bulb is about 30 years old and works as expected.  I'm very pleased with the product and the customer service.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact me via email.This is a great lamp.  I have used it for years and I can tell you that it's a quality product.  I would recommend it.This is a good product.  It's small and compact, but well made.  It's very bright.  I use it to light up a room and it's very good.  I have been using it for several months now and it's always bright.  I'm very pleased with the light and use it as a night light.  It's not a flash light, but it's nice"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,PROS:  tried this wanting to say it was a good flashlight but it didn't work. I bought two of the same. I also bought the T20 version of this flashlight that I have had in the past. The T20 version is very compact and gives you a great light. I have also tried the T20 version with the T40 and T40-6 and I have had them both work as well as the T40-6. I have not used the T20 version yet but I have tried the T20 version with the T40-6 and it has worked great. The T40-6 is not as bright as the T20 version but it is still bright enough to see if something is behind the counter. I had a few of these flashlights that I have tried but the T40-6 is very good for this kind of flashlight. I have had two of these flashlights that I have used for a few years and they are very good.

Pet_Supplies_5,1,"Bought this for our 11 lb. Lab. It is a little heavy for him, but he doesn't mind it. The bed is solid and is easy to clean. The material is nice and soft and it is easy to clean. The size is perfect for our pup. Great for the price. I have a German Shepherd and a German Shepherd mix. I've had this for about a year now and I love the fact that it's made of a durable, tough material that doesn't crack or tear. The smaller size does, however, feel a bit small for a German Shepherd, and the larger size doesn't hold a lot of weight. It's also made of some other sort of plastic, so I don't know why the material feels like it's made of a plastic. I have to give it a 5 for the price. I wouldn't go wrong with this one. It's very durable. I would recommend this for a German Shepherd. I love this food. I have been feeding it to my cats for about 2 years now."
Toys_and_Games_5,1,"The Mr. Pencil Stylus works better than the regular wooden pen.

The art style is pretty good.  The pen is plastic, but the paper is plastic, so it is pretty durable.

The pen is a little thin, but it is very soft.  The pen is not a very durable pen, and it will not last long.  I think the quality of the pen is great, but I think the pen is just too thin for a pencil holder.  Overall, I think this is a very good pen, and I'm not sure that it is worth the money.

If you like Mr. Pencil Stylus, you'll love this pen!

I'm sure I'll get another Mr. Pencil Stylus for my nephew.I got this for my daughter's 3rd birthday.  She loves it.  I love that it has a little ramp that makes it easier to get to the bottom of the pool.  My daughter is 4 and has had this for about a month now and it's been a hit!  She really enjoys playing with it.  It's easy to set up and she can use it on her own or with the other kids."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,Replaced 10 halogen bulb in my house and the light stays on all night for a very long time.I bought this to replace the old one that was running out of batteries.  This is a very well made flashlight.  I am very pleased with the quality of the product.  I received a 2 pack
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,It is simple. It is effective. It is made well. It holds on to your screws.  What more could you ask for?
Toys_and_Games_5,0,Got this for my 11 year old granddaughter and she loved it.
Kindle_Store_5,0,Southern Africa is such a complex place but this story gives a good outline to life post-apartheid for Africans and white descendants. It was certainly very nostalgic for me.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,Bought this for a tea party.  It's a good size and looks great in my kitchen
Kindle_Store_5,0,"The stories are good but the pictures leave something to be desired, in fact at times when we use this book there aren't pictures tat show up and at other times they do.
Kindle touch seems to be picky about pictures sometimes. Would consider buying a physical copy of this story book."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,I love this watch. I use the quick timer for watching the garden water and cooking. I set the alarm to remind me of places I have to be. It tells the correct time. I lasts and lasts. I had the battery replaced after a long time.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,1,"My girlfriend is 5""10 and this dress is just too tight for her.  The dress was just too tight and too short.  The dress also is too short, so it is not comfortable.  I would not recommend this dress to anyone.  This dress is so far beyond what I expected.  I have a wide chest and I can't even wear it"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"Prior to purchasing this kettle I had used an all steel kettle on my flat glass range.  I hate this stove because I have to be so careful heating things (it heats by magnetic induction so if the pot/pan/kettle has no metal, it won't heat it very well).  I had tried this glass kettle flat on the surface but it took 30 minutes to boil water (minimal magnetic stuff in this glass).  I was concerned about it cracking, but it survived as long as I ramped the heat up slowly and didn't just crank it.  I then tried various heat diffusors (cast iron grate, some other wire zig zag thing I had) but the best one is the clover metal wire that came with the kettle.  It now takes 10-15 minutes to boil water (it took 5 minutes in my metal kettle, but then my water tasted like metal).  Even when I straight up crank the stove temp to high, the kettle has shown no signs of breakage.  My only complaint which may be my stoves fault, is that even though no glass is touching the surface, I am still developing a brown halo stain around my burner.  What am I burning?  Air?  is something coming off of the glass?  I doubt it.  But I cant blame the kettle as it is doing its job even on my crummy stove.  Also the clover diffuser burns a stain into the glass, but with enough 409 and some elbow grease, and steel wool, I can get the stains off.

I have only been using this kettle for a month and the handle has not yet loosened, like so many reviewers are complaining.  If anything changes, I will update my review."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,Comes with 2 wall plates. Used both on 2 different thermostats.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,1,"awesome watch, loved it from the start and the price. I will keep it for a long time."
Kindle_Store_5,0,"Ice, a romantic suspense, is the first book in the Regulators MC series by Jessie Lane and Chelsea Cameron. Fans of Joanna Wylde will enjoy these sexy, bad arse, overly dominant alpha men who walk a fine line between justice and revenge. Action packed with plenty of violence and mayhem is tempered by an antagonistic humorous romance between a VERY grumpy biker-Ice-and the straight laced accountant that steals his heart. Though this can be read as a stand alone, the Ex Op series by Lane and the Hellion series by Cameron both introduce the Regulators and offer some background into their history."
Kindle_Store_5,0,"Just as the tidewater ebbs and flows with the moon's phases, love and family relationships ebb and flow depending on the choices made and the reasons for making them. The condition of the heart, whether selfless or selfish, colors the outcome and affects other lives.  Everything one does touches the other's life for good or for ill. Lisa Wingate has told a tale about two sisters who illustrate the consequences of taking opposite roads, one self serving, the other one selfless. It's a tale to cause the reader to think, really a parable
that shines like an iridescent blood moon on calm waters giving warning to choose wisely and without self serving agenda. Well written and worthwhile story."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,This flask is awesome. It took me a little bit to figure out where the shot glass was but after looking at the pictures on amazon i figured it out and quickly got the shot glass free from the flask. I love that the shot glass is collapsible you can this flask anywhere and have a shot. The flask is sturdy no leakage when tipped upside down which is a big plus. The shot glass fits perfectly on the side of the flask and comes off with ease. This is great for taking in the club with you instead of paying for outrageous drink prices slip this in your jacket pocket or purse and you have free drinks all night. Love the colors black and silver not to much but just the right beauty. All around this flask is great. Would make an excellent gift for fathers day or birthdays. I received this product for my honest review.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,1,I've worn New Balance shoes for a couple years now and I still love them. I'm just starting to get used to the comfort of these shoes and the fact that the heel is adjustable so that they can be worn in the same shoes as regular shoes.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"This Howard Leight Patriotic safety glasses kit is a nice set to show your patriotism at the shooting range. The glasses are well made and comfortable. The earplugs are a plus, but I don't know anyone will see the patriotic earplugs in my ear. Most importantly, they reduce the noise to a bearable level."
Kindle_Store_5,1,I'm not a fan of cliffhangers.  I've read a lot of books that just keep getting stuck in the middle.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,1,"Ladies don't underestimate the allure of an athletic shoe.  I will admit that I have been looking for a pair of the same shoe for a long time, and these are great.  The color is vibrant and the shoe is comfortable.  I wish I had gotten the two pairs for the same price.  I love the color and the fit.  They are a little heavier than I expected, but I guess I'll keep them for when I go back to New England for a day of walking around the house.  I have a wide foot and these fit well.  I'm a size 12 and ordered a medium.  The medium fit me perfectly.  It's a little snug around the toes and the heel does not dig into my toes.  It's also a little loose in the toe"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,"Nice and bright, stays solidly in place and does not interfere with the work of my small toolbox"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,"Although I'm happy with the purchase, I wouldn't recommend this product.

The only downside is that it's very hard to mount.  The ring itself is a bit difficult to mount to the mount and the screw on the rear end is loose."
Kindle_Store_5,1,I couldn't put it down.  I love the way these two came together and how the author kept the story moving forward.  I look forward to reading the next installment in

Books_5,1,"*****Spoiler Alert*****  This book is an easy read and you will need to read it in order to understand what is going on in the story. The characters are well developed and the plot is well developed. It is a very enjoyable read. This book is a great series for young people. I have read the book and I can't wait to see what happens next. I highly recommend it!This book was great for my 6 year old daughter who loves reading. She loves to read about the old times. I loved reading this book, she is 6 months old and it's a book she really enjoys. She is not only a fan of the old times but she loves the new ones too. I loved this book. It was an easy read and I was able to find some of the language in the book and I learned a lot about the people. I recommend this book to anyone who loves history and their favorite characters."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,Quality product that is an easy install and works as it should; nothing else much to say.
Movies_and_TV_5,1,This is a great family movie. The story is very good and the characters are very believable.
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"this seemed like one of the more higher end dog food since it cost twice as much as the dog food I got the first time I got my shelter dog.. She's a terrier mix (my vet tells me terriers are picky with food? I'm not entirely sure being a first-time dog owner), so I'm trying out different dog food that she'll like.. I saw great rating on this dog food, so I tried giving it a go, but she barely eats any! She'll only eat about a quarter of a cup an entire day, and start eating the grass outside when I take her out... I fed her the indoor mini dog royal canin stuff before, and that one smelled much nicer like a can of tuna (which made her poop smell nicer) and she actually ate her portions when I gave that to her. I was just hoping if I was going to spend that much money on dog food, I might as well find her the best one for her, but this one is a total miss.

I might give another brand besides royal canin a try (since it's so expensive...), but I'm going to stay away from the taste of the wild..."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,They may not be picture perfect machine-finished but the metal is good they hold up and do their job and were much better than I expected for the amazingly low price.
Toys_and_Games_5,1,"Bought this as a birthday present for my son.  He loves it!  I was disappointed.  If you want to get a solid and fun toy, this is it.  We bought it for his birthday and it's a good size for him.  He loves it!My daughter was thrilled to find this toy!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"It's small (under 2"" side to side) including the diffuser and just over 1"" for the light part. Sure it puts out heat but the diffuser reduces it somewhat and after all it is for halogen lamps.  I have only seen hot ones.  For me, it serves a special purpose by lighting that small area I use for tedious work such as watch repair and fine soldering on tiny electrical things (the scientific word defined as stuff).

While I really like the bulb I wish the company had included instructions and other elements about the life and uses just in case there would be other uses or functions that I have yet to encounter.  About the only extra information included is that the lamp is dimmable and it has a 3 year 25,000 hour warranty.  If it were to break in less than 3 years I would not know what to do.  The most important element in this lamp is that it is LED and that makes up for a bunch of missing information."
Electronics_5,1,"Hey, can't complain about this. I love the feel of the lens. The zoom is awesome. If you want to get a ""real"" zoom you'll need a tripod."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,1,"Absolutely love Vionic shoes! I have a pair of these in the same color and size. I ordered the same pair in the same size, but they're different colors. I'm very pleased with this purchase. It's a good value for the money. I love this dress. The material is soft and comfortable. I love the color and the fit. I ordered the brown color and it fits great."

Pet_Supplies_5,1,"My 2 cats are vicious eaters and they love these treats.  These treats are a treat to them and they love them.  I also like the flavor of the treats and it's a healthy alternative to the rawhide which is a favorite for cats.  I would definitely recommend these treats to others as they are the most healthy option for them and they are a treat to all of us.  This is not a dog food for cats but they like it.  I will definitely buy again in the future.my puppy loves these.  They last about a month.  When he gets old and starts having problems, he'll start getting the ""crunchy bits"" from these.I have three cats, two of them are tall, and one is short.  My cat was 3 and a half years old, and she was going through a traumatic experience.  I gave her a hard time not to cry when I got her to go to bed.

Movies_and_TV_5,0,"This movie reminded me of several episodes I saw on Law and Order and Special Victims regarding children sociopaths. It wasn't difficult to see that Kevin had a serious behavioural problem early on, as a viewer it was quite clear.  However, as a parent it would be very difficult to admit your child had little or no conscience  at all and was capable of committing such heinous acts.  My heart went out to Tilda Swinton for trying to deal with a child she realized had serious problems, with no one to turn to for help or guidance, it was quite hopeless.  I got the feeling from the start of her pregnancy and after the birth she never seemed happy about motherhood.  The question presents itself. Are the mother's feelings transferred to the child during pregnancy?  I recommend this movie to those who like realistic but difficult subject matter."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,I have two of these and have had no issues. I will update this review if I find any other problems.  The plastic parts are solid and the plastic is solid.  The metal part is well made and will last a long time.  This is an excellent product and should last long.  I have a few of these in the house and they are a great deal.  I just wish the lights were a little brighter and they will be brighter.This is a great tool for small jobs. It works well for smaller

Electronics_5,0,"I bought these as a replacement for an older pair of Sony earbuds. I don't know if this pair will eventually present the same problem, but my experience with Sony earbuds has been very mediocre.  First the good.  The sound is decent, though nothing special, and the fit is pretty good.  They are very comfortable and don't fall out, even when I'm jogging and sweaty.  My issue with Sony earbuds is that (with every pair I've owned over the last 10 years) the sound in one ear eventually goes out, never to return.  Then they're garbage.  My friends have all reported having the same problem and none of us has been able to figure out what causes this problem.  It does not appear to be something you can control by treating the earburs with special care of any sort.  I personally believe that Sony designs them to die on you, so that you'll constantly have to keep spending another $20 to replace them.  For my next pair (when these inevitably meet their one eared fate), I'm thinking of going higher end for a pair of earbuds that will last.  Do I recommend these as a pair of disposable earbuds that may give you 6 good months?  Yes.  Do I recommend them for longer?  No."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"The holster is really well made, it looks great, and I picked it up for a sweet price (goes up and down if you watch it), but I don't really use it. The belt loop is really big, I wear a 5.11 belt which is 1-1/4 or 1-1/2 in thick and there is still a ton of room for the loop to tilt in either direction. Kind of a bummer, but I can use it as back up when I can't pocket carry my J-frame."
Kindle_Store_5,0,"Definitely a great read. The characters are intriguing, and the story had a good flow. As a ""Red Dawn"" fan, I like this genre of storytelling. I can't wait to read the next book in the series."
Kindle_Store_5,0,"While the teaser on the book jacket moved me to buy this book, I couldn't finish reading it. The writing is uninspired, predictable. The story seems formulaic, safe - the sad stories of several women who meet at a knitting circle. The sadness is brought out pretty well, especially initially about the main character Mary's loss. But too much of sadness going on and on works against the story, I feel, so I began to ignore the emotional meanings and look for the story.

I tried to keep at it, but I gave up halfway, which is rare for me to do. I actually skipped the stories of two of the women - you know they are coming, and you don't care about any of them so why should you be forced to read what sad things they went through? Disappointing book."

Electronics_5,0,"I've bought 3 of these cables. The 1st one was to replace a $230 50ft hdmi cable that was sold to me by the company that I bought a projector from. Someone tried to swap devices and broke the head of the expensive cable, so I bought one of these to replace it and it worked every bit as good as the expensive cable.

When we set up our 2nd theater room, I just went with this cable again.

I have noticed that some blu-ray players work better than others as do projectors/tvs as far as sending/receiving signals over longer distances. The cable doesn't seem to make that much difference - So I'd go with this cheaper cable and still feel safe that it will work for you.

PROS:
The price is great.
The cable is well made and thick
Performs every bit as good as the expensive cables.

CONS:
I did have one cable break that I used in a mobile set up. The cable got a short after repeated set ups and take downs - as long as you don't plan on moving the cable around a lot after it is in place you shouldn't have any problems. The cable was broken when an inexperienced person coiled the cable up after use and folded the neck of the cable next to the head at a 90 degree angle (tightly wound) the cable still works but I have to ""jiggle"" it a little to get the connection to work correctly...
(Not the cables fault - but thought I'd mention in case you plan on using in a mobile set up)

Side note:
Sometimes if the tv or projector is turned on after the dvd player or whatever is sending the signal, I've gotten a no signal message. If I turn the projector on first or turn the dvd player off then back on the signal is picked up. Not sure if this has anything to do with the cable but didn't have that small problem with the expensive cable."
Electronics_5,1,"The very first time I saw this, I thought it was a nice piece of equipment.

It is great for packing a large container of coffee. I bought this to replace a broken one I bought a year ago. I did not want the old one to become a complete mess. I wanted a great item to replace a broken one that had a broken seal."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"I love my Healthy Human bottle! I have one. My husband has one. We have the metal pint glasses. It's super rare to find a company that ALL their products are really that good. And to make it better- my bottle didn't seem to keep cold when I first got it more than a regular glass did. I emailed their customer service and same day they sent me a new one and were super friendly. Awesome customer service.
Yea, 32 bucks is pricey for a water bottle but it is well made. I am terrified to bonk it against anything accidentally- it's pretty loud from the double wall and has a very loud clang it makes sounding like you broke it (it's actually really sturdy)

But it does what it says! The finish is awesome and durable, the handle is great. If you are tearing through Amazon looking for a great insulated bottle, this is it. Trust me, I did the research. This is up there with Yetis, S'well, etc. It's aweosme but way more functional."

Kindle_Store_5,0,"I said just what I needed, and I meant it. This book goes into a lot of detail, however I was particularly interested in the sections on plants that work well, gardening bed ideas, the tools, and reading about the disadvantages. I live in a small but tall building with plenty of room on the roof. The space is not shared, so my wife has always wanted to grow her own vegetables on the roof. She got the idea from an article about urban agriculture, and she always wanted to know more. After I read the book, it was clear that it is perfectly possible, without the disadvantage of the cost mentioned. In my opinion it is affordable, and this book really showed me how. If you are in a similar situation to me, I would recommend reading this to see just how viable raised garden beds are. Thanks."

It has a lot of action, great story, and it is not only that, it is a good movie.  I was a huge fan of the original, and now I like the new one.  I wish they would have done a sequel, as I have never seen them.  I don't really know what the story is about, but it is good, and I really enjoyed it.

Pet_Supplies_5,0,"I've had this model for several years and was delighted to find a replacement(s) on Amazon.  They are BIG and 2 of them are perfect for our 4 indoor cats.  I remove the flap in front *and* the upper part of the flap on top (needs some muscling to remove the latter).  2/3s of one of the 38lb green plastic containers of litter from CostCo fills it somewhat deeply.  I clean once a day and backfill litter as necessary.  I do not use the locking mechanisms (see removing flaps!).  One plus to this container is that I have a cat that -tho fixed- occasionally likes to pee while semi-standing up (not true spraying).  The back of the bottom pan is higher than the front which really helps.

Forgot - If you have a very large cat, removing the top part of the flap is key....

LATER 2/28/16 - decided to keep the top part for one box as our female cat is shyer .... ALSO .... you will get a teench of leakage if a tall cat stands absolutely upright to pee (maybe I should have kept both top portions?)  I also plan to try a ""top entry"" box for the schnook."

Movies_and_TV_5,0,"This film reminded of ""The Hand that Rocks the Cradle."" George Harriman (Lou Felder) a poorly developed character has been terminated from his fictional movie company for embezzling and to top it all off he might go to prison. Like any white collar criminal faced with ""hard"" time in a federal pen, he opts to do the honorable thing and shoot his family and himself...except for some reason he omits his daughter who is a nurse (Lisa Zane as Laura Harriman ).

When George's former boss Bob (Michael Fairman) hears about it he goes catatonic, like Ned seeing the Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka (South Park season 2). Laura assumes a new identity to infiltrate the home as a nurse so she can bump off Bob's family in front of him.

The terror and acting were both lame. Except for the rare F-bomb, this could have been a made for TV movie. Perhaps my biggest disappointment was right after I obtained this film I discovered it was available in a multi-film pack for the same price.

Rare F-bomb, no sex or nudity. What this movie really needed was for Demi Moore to play the lead with a token shower scene and a little more success and creativity in killing off relatives."

Kindle_Store_5,0,"I received this book free for review. I am not being compensated or influenced.

I could not put this book down. I devoured it in a matter of an hour and a little bit, and it blew my mind. Devlin is by far one of my favorite male leads of anything Ive read this year. Hes strong, smart, sensitive and tough. Hes been held prisoner for years, but some seriously nasty villains, and despite torture and terrible things happening to him, he remains true to himselfa healer not a fighter. Which just makes me so happy.

Jamie is another great character, she grew on me pretty steadily throughout the novel. I really love their chemistry together, and the fact that the female character was the stronger in the relationship. Devlin is not an alpha malebut it works so well with Jamie who pulls him out of everything and works to make their world better. This is the fourth book in a series, but it didn't feel like I was coming into the story mid-way. Characters from previous books show up and are mentioned but theres enough context to determine who is who without giving away their stories."

It has a beautiful look and great quality.  I bought it for my cat because he has a very sensitive stomach and it is very easy to clean.  The only issue I have is that it does not smell very good.  I put it in his bathtub and it doesn't smell very good.  I had to buy another one to replace the old one.  I only used this one for a few days.  It is still going strong.

UPDATE:  I have purchased this for my cat, who is a very aggressive chewer.  He is now a little more gentle and has not gotten very upset about the other litter boxes I have purchased for him.  The cats are happy with this one and so are I.

Toys_and_Games_5,0,"I guess the biggest criticism I have of this toy, is really my own fault for not reading the description more thoroughly. I assumed this toy would be perfect for my daughter's bathtime, or to play with in the pool.

That's not the case. Everything sinks right to the bottom it you place it in water.

With that said, and admittedly that is more my error than the manufacturer's, the Party Yacht is a fun little playset. The Party Yacht is like two sets in one. The kids can play with the set like it's a big boat, and the yacht can also ""unfold"" to create a cool little resort, with slides, a grill, a hammock and a jet-ski complete with a harness for water skiing.

Assembly is a breeze, just snap a couple pieces onto the yacht, fold it up (or keep it open) and it's ready to go. While I still think it would've been a smart move to make this into a water toy, my daughter enjoys the set as is."

I will definitely buy again.Cats love it!Great.  I have a 60lb terrier mix and this is his favorite toy.  He will rip out the stuffing and tear up anything in a matter of seconds.  I like that it is soft and doesn't fall apart.  I would definitely buy again. "
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"I hate ordering clothing online, but I took a chance on these and I'm so happy I did!  These are incredibly comfortable and stylish (although the top is an elastic band, so I wouldn't recommend wearing with a short top)  I haven't been able to get rid of my mommy tummy and regular pants were cutting right into it, creating the muffin top and I was really self-conscious about it.  These pants stay in place and keep their shape really well, so I don't have to keep pulling them up and they don't stretch out while I'm wearing them, so no butt sag.  And they really do a great job of keeping my tummy looking flat, but without pinching.  These really are the perfect pants!  I'm currently a size 6 and I could have gone down to a 4 in these, so keep that in mind.  They have a standard inseam, but they're a little short on me, so if you have long legs, also keep that in mind.  I've recommended these to all my friends and I'll be buying more in the future."

Electronics_5,0,"Okay so logitech has been very well known in making good webcams. This cam arrived ontime. There however was a problem where the mic wasn't really working well or something. I returned it and got another one that seems to work pretty well.

Now the video quality is pretty good. Even though it might not be the best compared to their newest one (That long blue expensive webcam they just came out with a year ago) but its pretty good if you want a cam that is cheaper, especially after the rebate if they are still offering one.

Unfortunately the mic seems to not be the best it could have been but considering my previous webcam was so old it was fuzzy looking this mic works a lot better. I wanted one with a really good mic as well as good video quality. The video quality is great but the features it comes with are kinda lacking. Im talking about the little animations and such. You don't get a lot when you first install it you have to hunt down some good ones on the website in order to get some cool looking ones.

The other features such as low light can be good or bad depending on how you use them. Also the ""right sound"" seems to just make things worse I think. Its hard to say since I don't use my webcam that often.

However I think this is one of the better webcams you can pick these days. Just make sure to check it out and try it out a bit right away when you get it just incase you get a faulty one like I did. Oh and logitech has a forum for questions and they usually answer them right away or within a day or two. I have bought quite a few logitech products and even though sometimes I come across one or two that I need to return, in the long run they have good products."

Toys_and_Games_5,0,"I purchased one of these at Wal-Mart for $10.00. In my 50's now I always wanted to have one. I don't know why some people had issues or put it down. First off I sent for the ants which cost another $5.00 for S&H right through the website. It took 10 days to receive them, keep in mind if you live somewhere it's cold or too hot you will wait longer. After receiving the ants, only one dead one, I followed the instructions closely. First making 4 starter tunnles with the tool and then cooling down the ants in the fridge for 15 minutes then putting them in. It took less the 24 hours and the ants started working. Each ant has different jobs. Some dig, some remove debris and some just stand guard near the lid. Someone reviewed it didn't light up well; maybe they didn't put batteries in it! Mine lighted up well! The only hard part to this is the fact you have to put the whole farm in the refrigerator for at least 75 minutes to slow the ants up to clean out the debris as they are very fast and will try to escape. I have it 3 weeks so far and lost maybe 5 ants as they do die off and do not lay eggs since there is no queen. Like any other creature sometimes they dig other times they rest.  I do believe its fun to watch and well worth the 10 bucks. I guess I'm a kid at heart, get one and enjoy the fun!"

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"High quality with very nice features. Having the ability to pause the water stream or stop it just by touching the spout or handle comes in handy whether you are washing your hands or doing dishes. You can save money with this feature. The faucet looks very good with nice styling. It comes with PEX hoses and very easy connection features. The faucet is designed for 4"" to 18"" spread between the handle and spout, but I do not recall that being specified in the advertisements. Our large single bowl sink caused the two to be mounted at opposite sides at the rear of the sink--20"" apart center to center. I soon discovered that the spout grounding wire and the LED spout indicator cable would not reach that distance. The grounding wire is a single conductor so it was easy enough to splice and solder some additional wire to span the distance. The LED cable is a three conductor cable with a jack and receptacle connection. To span the extra distance I purchased an extension cable from Radio Shack--designed for use with stereo connections/computer connections etc. The faucet works well, simply and effectively. No leaks."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"I love the new Antidote reservoirs by Camelbak. I've used several generations of Camelbak's ""mil spec"" reservoirs both while I was in the military and just for hiking and camping. I've also used several other brands' hydration pouches to less than satisfactory results. Camelbak has improved on the their already great design though. These new reservoirs are light weight, open and close easily with just a quarter turn of the cap to lock it in place, have insulated hoses, have protected bite valves and an on/off switch at both ends of the hose so water doesn't spill when disconnecting any pieces while the reservoir is full. The new ones also have like a spine down the middle of the reservoir so it holds a shape to make filling and dropping into a pack easier. I've never been able to burst one either. Neither throwing the pack, nor having other packs stacked on my own, or dropping it down to someone from the top of a cliff or just by sitting on it because it's more comfortable than rocks have destroyed any of the half dozen or so reservoirs I've owned.

This is the short model, its short and wide instead of tall and thin but still holds the max 100 oz. I use it with a 5.11 Rush 24 backpack which the regular (tall) reservoir BARELY doesn't fit in without bending or filling less than full. It's also a good for if you want to keep the center of gravity low in a pack."

One of my friends has a Penny Board and when you compare it to this, you can tell that this is amazing quality for such a lower price. The only difference is that a Penny Board is a little smoother and will most likely last longer. This would be a terrific option for those who would want to save a little money.

Kindle_Store_5,1,This is the second in a series and the first in the series by Stephanie Scott. I just can't get enough of her books. I can't wait to read the next one. The story is well written and the characters are well developed. I highly recommend this book. Great series with great characters. I liked the characters and the storyline.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,Item arrived nicely packaged and in good time. I was not as excited about the item once I realized that the poles that come with it only sit in the holders. The package comes with 5 poles and 10 holders and a storage bag. You place the poles on the holder and proceed. You also get a link to an e-book that gives you ideas of how to use the product - which is a nice bonus. I was actually thinking the poles snapped into the holder but they do not. I contacted the seller and was advised that they did it this way as a precaution so the poles will just fall out if you trip or something. I personally would have preferred that they lock in but they work the same as long as you don't trip. As noted the e-book gives you several set-up ideas to use for a variety of workouts. It probably would take two sets to really get a full use out of the system. It is very versatile and made well.

Movies_and_TV_5,0,"I've read a number of true crime books, but haven't delved too much into movies.  I was actually steered towards this one - which I'd never heard of - by a review on another movie, so three cheers to Amazon reviewers for helpful recommendations!

The movie intrigued me for a number of reasons - true crime, drama, and John Cusack playing a character other than, well, John Cusack.  Don't get me wrong, I love the heck out of a socially awkward, passionate about music, good looking & articulate guy as much as everyone, but I was interested in seeing him portray a different sort of character.  He does so well, the average guy next door with twisted desires and dark secrets, pushed to the edge of discovery by Nicholas Cage, playing - well, not Nicholas Cage.  You know, the somewhat over the top slightly kooky guy?  Not this time.  It's a nice role reversal on the good guy/bad guy dynamic that they had in Con Air (which I'll need to watch again soon) with both parts played quite convincingly and realistically.

The theme and the setting of the movie is dark, a pallor cast over it from early on that makes you want to see if your monitor or TV has changed settings while you weren't paying attention.  The action mainly comes in the form of suspense, with some difficult scenes and little humor to break the mood, or even worse, mock the truth behind the tale.

Given that this is based on a true story, I felt it was written, scripted, and acted out with respect for what happened, and for the victims and their families.  Demons do live among us, sometimes frighteningly close, with angels as passionate about protecting people as the demons are about hurting them."

Kindle_Store_5,0,"So this is a series novel....not a big fan of those. Since this book is the start of the series, you would think that the author would have taken her time setting the story up. When the H and h meet for the first time the chemistry is instantaneous. I'm okay with because sometimes in life you meet a person and that can happen. HOWEVER, to have these two meet have sex and then decide they are in love? I'm calling straight BS on that. And what man wants to dive head first into some woman's drama because she's so beautiful and he just has to have her in his life?  And here we go once again with the black woman always having green eyes ,hazel eyes, light brown eyes,etc. Why not just beautiful brown eyes? I'm being petty sorry. Anyway the story although good moves along way too fast for me. They meet..she introduces him to her drama...he protects...they have sex...her life gets threatened again...there's a big dramatic scene with the villain H saves the day... this time they have unprotected sex...then proposes like a week later or three months later...either way. Too soon. I like it when a relationship gets to marinate the characters get to know each other the chemistry and suspense build up so that we can genuinely be excited when the two main characters come together...none of that happened here."

Kindle_Store_5,0,"This is a sweet book about a loving married couple, Frank and Wendy, with three kids. They've been married over a decade and still love each other a lot, but over time the passion has faded in their sex lives.

Frank is busy with his job as an accountant. He is very methodical. He thinks things are fine between him and his wife, but mostly because he has stopped paying attention. He finds himself masturbating nearly every day, afraid of burdening his wife with his carnal needs.

Wendy is a stay at home mother of three rambunctious boys. She loves her husband, but finds that he no longer satisfies her in the bedroom. She has immersed herself in the erotic novels on her Kindle. The dominant book boyfriends provide her with plenty of masturbatory fantasies to get her through the day. Her BOB (battery operated boyfriend) is her best friend.

Things change when Frank accidentally takes his wife's Kindle to work with him by mistake. He discovers the erotic world that his wife has been visiting, and he realizes for the first time that things may not be as okay as he thought they were.

Frank, using his analytical accountant mind, begins to read, research and analyze the books his wife has been fascinated by. He learns all about BDSM, and dominant/submissive role play. He even joins Fetlife, an online message board for those in the lifestyle. He learns all he can, and he is determined to become the dominant man his wife needs him to be.

This is a standalone novel, and one of the better ones I've read in a while. Don't expect any kind of major angst here. It's just a sweet story of two people rediscovering the passion they once had for each other."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,"Revised review.

The first season I had an issue with the latch closing after a few weeks of use. The latch closed too easily and I had to re-open the latch to get it open again. The second season I had a problem with the latch closing after several weeks of use. The latch closes a bit too easily, and it also opens a bit too easily with a strong force. I have had this problem with the first season and the second season. Both issues are very similar.

I have used this for the past year, and I am very satisfied with the results.

Pros:

- Easy to use
- Very easy to read

Cons:
- Difficult to read

I would recommend this product to anyone.

Update:

I am now getting some feedback from people that have reported problems with this latch.

Electronics_5,0,"I bought my first set of these headphones about a year ago.  I was able to look past the annoyingly long right ear wire because they do have excellent sound quality.  I used them mainly at the gym and noticed that after being on the treadmill for a few minutes that the combination of sweat and the weight of the cord would pull the left earpiece out.  I tried all 3 rubber sizes but was constantly pushing that left piece back in.  Also, when lifting weights I run the cord under my shirt and found that the thick rubber piece where the right and left earphones split would catch my shirt and again pull the left earpiece out, even more often than while running.  This was annoying, but I would still have rated these 4 stars because walking my dog or listening in bed these were the best phones I ever heard.  I bought 2 other pairs as Christmas presents last year, and now all 3 pairs have failed in one ear.  I tried re-soldering the wires and got 2 of them to work again, who knows for how long.  I have switched to a pair of Ultimate Ears and the quality is even better, hopefully these will last longer."

Books_5,1,"Inventor, author, and futurist, Ray Bradbury, has done an outstanding job of describing the complex universe of the human mind. The book is both entertaining and enlightening, and it is a truly readable and well-written book. Bradbury is an American with an excellent knowledge of science and math. He is also the creator of several books, and one of the best examples of this is his book, ""The End of Science: A Practical Guide to New Sciences"". Bradbury is a superb writer, and his work is well worth reading. I recommend this book to everyone. I am a big fan of Bradbury's work. This is a wonderful book about a man who is at the top of his game. He has a heart of gold and a love for his country. He is very tough, with good intentions.

I have tried calorie counting and exercising but I feel like nothing has been able to help. I know that keeping this extra around the middle can be dangerous to my health, so I needed to do something fast. I picked up this ebook because it seemed straight forward, and I am glad I got it!

""Losing Belly Fat"" really helped jump start my game again by helping me cover all my bases. The books talks about what types of fat their are, what kind of foods pack on the fat, and how to demolish that fat. I am grateful for the belly busting exercises included so I can really talk with a trainer about working on my core. Also included are a 5 day diet plan and diet pills that can actually help lose loose those pounds.

But it did allow me to hard wire my media center extenders to my network as well as my media center PC.  I have a much more secure connection now.  I do get speeds of about 40mbps most of the time, and I am reasonably satisfied with that since that is a pretty big jump in performance."

The only thing I can say is that it does a great job of removing the residue and removing the odor.I was skeptical about the price for this product but I found it a bit too expensive. I did get a free shipping and it was a great deal. I have a 4 month old lab and he's 8 lbs and I have a 60lb lab. He's a bit of a chewer so I was worried about him not getting enough of this. However, he does have a few extra pounds so I got it for him. He loves it and I'm glad I got it. I will probably buy another one for him.I like the color and quality.

It's a little hard to balance it with the other two toys. I think it's a good toy to keep them engaged and to have on hand for play.I bought this for my son to use as a teaching toy.  He likes it, and so does my son.  He is now learning about the alphabet, letters, and numbers, and is enjoying playing with it.  It is easy enough for him to grasp and put together, but hard for him to put down and take it out of the box.  I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the show.  My son is almost 3 and loves to play with it.  It is very well made and really fun.  I would recommend this to anyone with a child who loves teaching letters and numbers.This is a great way to teach kids to be creative and creative.

Kindle_Store_5,0,"This is a lovely piece and can certainly be read by younger audiences, but with some violence (but by nowhere in the league of violence as Hunger Games). It holds the attention as Ellie struggles with dealing with her classmates to her discovering a new world and struggling to find her place within the new community as well to discovering who she is and growing as a character.  And it even follows the girl she got mistaken for as she also tries to fit in with a different environment. I especially loved Ellie's brother Paul and loved their relationship, even though it was a minor detail in the story. In all, Amber Rain is a fun dystopian experience that reinvents the world with new threats and different ways of living and the task of surviving."

The figure stands up okay, but is clearly not as stable as many of the male sculpts (which tend to be in wider stances to begin with, and have larger feet).

Some have complained about the paint, and I agree it could be better, but mine has no deal-breaking flaws. There's a picture floating around these reviews of a Ripley with a big dot of paint inside her right hand. Mine has one too, but I think it's actually supposed to suggest the back of her rifle's grip, rather than being a paint error."

Kindle_Store_5,0,"Jet, the 6th episode of Secret Confessions: Backstage  is the hottest of the series and one story Id like to see continued.  Jet is the real drive behind The Screaming Tuesdays, the real master of their music.  All the Tuesdays are talented in their own right, but Jet is the total package, even though his voice is his instrument on stage, he can play all instruments well (though he demurs about bagpipes).  He is obsessive about his notebook, where he keeps his works-in-progress, his thoughts and his secrets.  He has been wanting to get his hands (mouth, body) on Charlie since he first saw her on the first day of the US tour.

Charlie has been embedded with The Screaming Tuesdays since the beginning of the US tour.  A reporter looking for the in-depth true story about the band, the tour and the individual Tuesdays; she has kept her distance from all the members of the band and their support team.  She wants nothing to tarnish her reputation as a reporter and devalue her work.  She knows how quickly her reputation can be lost if she is linked to anyone she interviews.  She has been painfully aware of Jet from the first moment and has delayed his interview until the last.

The last day of the tour, the last night, after the last concert, Charlie is scheduled to do her in-depth interview with Jet.  Jet made a decision to avoid alcohol for the US tour; he states hes not an alcoholic and it is just a personal choice.  The Tuesdays have been betting against him, but the US tour is over and the betting pool is unclaimed.  Yanis brings Charlie to Jets suite just as hes about to shower off after the performance.  Jet doesnt want to do the interview with Charlie because hes unsure he can keep his hands off her.  Chicago is about to get hot!"

for the hat this is perfect. its so tiny and lightweight it will work great for its intended purpose. I tried it on my hat and lights up well enough to see where you are going. not going to light up the whole yard but perfect for normal wallking and even for reading a book etc.

I was going to try to compensate for angle but didn't - too much work. Instructions are weak... not terrible, but I had trouble understanding a few things and kept re-reading - was not as clear as could be on how to thread the nylon string through the pulleys... I also wish it had adjustable mounts to accomodate angled ceilings better. It would be nice, too, if bracket mounts were made to screw into 2x4 ceiling joists.

If you have a solid ceiling, especially a flat ceiling, these will be easy to install, if you have a high open ceiling, especially with steep angle, it will require more work and improvising... but once installed, keeps my bike up out of the way."

I must admit folding it up again was a chore and I still am not sure I got it right.

Everything about this is rocking. Quality, ease of installation, operational modes and even the look and feel. I am with an electrical engineering background so that may not be fair to say ""ease"" of installation but I did think it to be quite easy.

Love the stepping mode for the lights. I used 4 new LED in the light part of the ceiling fan and if you want to dim a bit, you have plenty of levels. It also saves the point you want for a quick change to the level you find to be good for you. Same with the fan for everything described; stepping, favorite spot, off/on etc.

Only one minor gripe is that the remote must be pointed at the switch unit as this is where it picks it ip. IR, not RF. This is not a major deal at all unless you have something sitting right in front of it."

The lighter exercise band when stretched rolled up a few times on me and I would have to unroll and start again.  I guess because I was pulling it out so hard.  The others did fine.  I could feel the tightness with those as I stretched it out.  I may lay flat and try it on my ankles and legs next.  I left out of town so I have not been able to test it that way.

Electronics_5,0,Does the job.  Plenty of room for backups on both my and my spouse's computers.  I would prefer a cable with standard USB on both ends.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"I have been using this product for more than two weeks now. In that time, I've had an opportunity to evaluate both the quality of the product and the overall usability. In creating this review I've considered both the type of material used in making the product as well as the overall fit and finish. I've also considered how well the product meets my needs and whether there are any shortcomings or particular advantages in using this product.

For this particular product, the type of material used in the manufacture and creation of the product seems to be of very good quality. One must consider that for any product of this type there is a balance between the type of material used and the cost that is to be passed on to the consumer. I think for this product that balance has been met fairly well and I believe that the product will meet the expectations of most buyers.

With regard to the fit and finish of this particular product, I believe it to be about average for the products of similar make or style. That is to say that it is not of poor or moderate craftsmanship/finish nor is it something that I would rate as outstanding. The quality of the piece is such that I feel it is a good value for the money.

Finally, as with many products of this type, the value that a consumer sees is dependent on the expectation. When I ordered this product my expectations were moderate, especially because of the price. In an age where we demand low price but often want high quality, it is often best if we expect moderate to good quality instead. I did that with this product as was pleasantly surprised to find that the quality was at least good, if not just a tad bit better than good. For that reason, and those set out above, I'd make a recommendation to buy this product."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,Perfect. It gives just enough light and is light weigh but sturdy. I actually put this on the top of a tall secretary that sits in a dark corner of my living room and it really lights up the dark spot. I am very pleased.

Electronics_5,1,"The main description for this speaker is ""120W"" which is a lot of noise cancelling.

I had to replace a speaker that is around 30W to get it to work properly.

I will update this review as it progresses.

The speakers are not the best speakers. They have a bit of a ""sweet spot"" on the speaker base which is a nice touch.

The wire seems pretty weak. It's like a wire that will break if it is bent or bent.

I would buy this speaker again.

Bottom line: this speaker is a good speaker for $20 or less.Works perfectly.  It is a very good product.I'm a huge fan of the Roku and I've used it for over a year. "

I read some people had problems with the head not retracting.
I put the old weight on the the hose along with the new one - works for me.

I love the the easy button switch to stop the water temporarily.  Say I want to fill a pot on the counter.  Turn on the water, grab the head, push the stop button, and no splash or wet counters.
 I've had issues with other one handle faucet designs shutting off by themselves.  The faucet I replaced would only stay on if I had the water on full blast.  This handle does not do that.  Now I can peel eggs under water easily.

I can't attest to durability yet, but so far so good."

I like that it's not a toy for kids that is too loud, so it will be okay for my son.  I would have liked it more if it had more features.

I would not have bought it if it was a little bigger.  I would have given it 5 stars if it was a little smaller.  I would have liked it a little larger.

The sounds are loud and remind me of (if you can fathom this) a raspy-throated human infant processed through a vocoder synth. Our lab seemed a little scared of it at first (as was I!) but she quickly got the deal and loves it now.

She's a medium-large 75+ pound yellow lab yet she can't quite get her jaws far enough around the ball to carry it - if it were just an inch or so smaller in diameter it would be perfect. But she loves to nudge it around the living room and through corridors.

It's extremely hard plastic and durable - she plays with it inside and out, though the sounds carry far less outdoors (fine by me!)."

The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because the box is a bit small, but if you don't mind it being a bit small it's a good size for a small dog.

This is a great standalone story and book three in the series.  Book One introduced the concept of two worlds post war, divided by hidden portals. Cascadia is a world without technology or motorized vehicles and it citizens have paranormal abilities the Pacificans covet. For years the Pacifican Army has created crime waves they attribute to the Cascadians, giving them the reason they need for sustaining funding and support to continue their troop numbers.  They also seek out descendents of Cascadians living in Pacifica who have paranormal abilities and force them into the army. Those who refuse are incarcerated.  The more promising of these Talents are sent to a research lab, The Institute.  That is where Vince Crawford has been held for the past ten years, refusing to give up information about a portal he discovered that led him to Cascadia and Zara Kane, the girl he fell in love with.

Zara had just told Vince she was pregnant when he disappeared. Thinking he abandoned her, she is shocked to learn he has been imprisoned the whole time. Fiercely determined to free him, she convinces her brother to help and uses her cloaking Talent to get Vince away from his work detail and to a safe house. But neither of the lovers are the same people they were before Vince was taken. Their resulting story is one of bravery, love and patience in the face of Vince's PTSD and the force of the Pacifican Army intent on recapturing their most valuable prisoner."

Pet_Supplies_5,0,"Wow, I cut a small dog off my dog!  I used to cut my kids' hair when they were little and they always threatened to hold me down and cut mine one day.  Photos will show I was not good at it.  So with clippers and a dog, what could go wrong?  The dog, a shaggy little Border Terrier who had a 7 month growth of hair.  Never having been a good one for reading instructions, I jumped in and started playing with blade guards.  The middle one was the best place to start and then I started testing guards to see which one cut closer.

After an hour and lots of fun, there was a small dog of hair on the ground, but my real dog still looked like she could lose a little more hair.  Hey, it will grow back, right?

My back took a rest while I had a cool drink, then I plopped the dog on the patio table (duh, should have done this to begin with) and started cutting with just the clippers and no guard.  Whoohoo, first cut took out a divot.  Damn, these things are really cool.  As I developed a smoother stroke, we ended up with a really passable haircut.

What I learned: do not cut a wet dog and it will grow back.

I saved about $40 bucks for a haircut and had an immeasurable amount of fun.  Now, what else can I trim?  The other 3 dogs are all short haired, but wait....hey cat, come back here!"

Movies_and_TV_5,0,"By reputation, Meryl Streep seals her legend in this hardly observed crime who-dunnit receiving no Oscar nod or Academy mention for a performance that is astoundingly real in its exactness in the character of Lindy Chamberlain charged with the murder of her own daughter in the Australia back water, near Alice Springs, along with her husband Michael (Sam Neill), both devout Christians, a case that was solved a year after the picture's release. It is one thing to capture the virtuosity of Streep, but to present the trials and tribulations of innocent, accused parents under the microscope of media and bombarded by innuendo at every turn wearing testimony and beliefs to the pressure point is an extraordinary piece of cinema. If you followed this film with ""Silkwood"" you would see two distinct individuals played by the same actress. And, of course, Meryl Streep continues to stretch our imaginations. The supporting cast is familiar to those who fancy Australian offerings. However, this film is unique in its documentary feel with artistic touches, like complete authenticity to the decent character of the principals, that heighten its impact. Here, the viewers as well as the lead characters are tested by fire and survive. This is a Streep performance you must see."

When I finally ran out (who thinks about buying roller covers from Amazon) and couldn't find more at my local hardware store or home center, I bought others made by Purdy, Shur-Line and other well-known brands. None were ever as good as these. Purdy makes excellent paint brushes, but their rollers are merely OK and tend to make bubbles. Shur-Line makes excellent edgers but I never used any of their covers that didn't shed. Even Shur-Line's most expensive, top of the line ""premium select"" roller covers with their ""shed resistant technology"" shed badly. It's not the paint - I only buy Benjamin Moore and it's about $65 a gallon these days. They even tolerate cleaning well, if you want to you can get two or three uses out of a cover, but at this price why bother?

So after failing to find anything better, I bought another set of these Wooster covers from Amazon. Once again I am pleased. They hold paint well, don't leave bubbles, and absolutely do not shed. They're better than ones I've paid three times as much for."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"I was looking for a white plastic mailbox post that would fit a large mailbox (Solar Group E1600), that wasn't over $100. I liked the idea of the vortex anchor for this, but the reviews of that were horrible, so I used a standard pressure treated 4x4. The post slides right over it and then you use lag screws to secure it. Oddly you screw it at the edge/corners and not the center of the sides. It made it slightly more challenging, but not impossible. The base also fits snuggly, but is not secured, so you can raise it up to trim grass. The best feature is that the mailbox support is not part of the post, so when you install it you can put it at the exact height you want, so you don't have to plan EXACTLY where the base will be to get the mailbox height correct, you can adjust afterwards.

An installation note, if using a 4x4. You don't have to make the wood post as tall as the mailbox post, the instructions tell you only to make it a foot or so above ground. While I bought an 8' post, and made mine almost as tall as the mailbox post. I could have bought a 4' post instead and would've been fine. (I actually looked for a 6' one, but all Big Orange had less than 8' was the 4'.) That might make it easier to install, and bring the post home. I also thought it was worth renting a post hole digger, I wanted it deep, I knew the roadbed was close (no curb here), and I wanted to save time."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"Update: July 11, 2014
I hade been giving the Princess Pia (my aging Siamese cat) other products to help ease her arthritic joints, asd could not see any improvement. Then I tried Nutramax Cosequin.  But when I tried mixing Nutramax into her food, she wouldn't eat her food.  I can't think WHY I keep thinking my (overweight) cat will starve, but I finally overcame my fear and kept putting it into her food - and she finally ATE it!

Well, to keep this short, She now gets it twice daily and she eats it every time.  She also runs, jumps, climbs, and chases a little ""critter"" that hangs on a long string from a helium balloon (her current favorite toy).  She hadn't been doing any of those things, and had a bad limp.  Now she's very active and her limp is barely perceptible.  I'm ordering it again."

The cutting board can be inserted either with the ""drip catcher"" grooves up or down. We have a small convection oven and a large toaster on top, so we chose to leave the grooves on the down side.
The top shelf is narrow but is nice for smaller items. The two larger shelves below the wood top now hold a cast iron dutch oven, a bread machine, two crock pots and a set of very large bowls.
The feet are adjustable so that you can level the unit so it won't wobble.

Electronics_5,0,"I've wrestled with lots of screen protectors over the last couple years; cameras, cellphones, GPS systems, iPods, Kindle 2.  This Green Onions protector was easy peasy and looks great. It looks exactly like the Kindle screen- no glare. It is a little bit smaller than the screen which is a good thing since it simplifies application. It is always such a pain to try to apply one that is EXACTLY the same size. I never get it lined up perfectly with the screen and have to endlessly fiddle with it. The Green Onions is sturdy which makes it easier to handle than the thinner films. My first try was a keeper. One teeny tiny bubble that I can live with. There are two in the pack which is probably a good idea for first timers with screen protectors, but it would have been nice to be able to purchase a single for those of us with experience and established technique."

But it has some issues.

First it seemed to use a lot of juice. I seemed to be putting batteries in it every so often. That was not that much of a pain.

But I discovered that once a station was program into the radio there was no way to blank it out. All you can do is program another station in that pre-set. In other words there was no way to clear all or any of the pre-sets. I tried and tried all to no avail.

I am just not that thrilled with radio. I have seen gone back to the simply little Sony radio that costs about $30 or so. That bad boy is rugged, easy to use and lasts forever on one battery. The Sangean takes two."

That was horrible.  So I'm back to this one again, and we can connect them all together to form a huge marble run. We're having a lot of fun with this.

Electronics_5,0,"I have had many Sony Walkman's over the years. The sound on this one simply does not compare. It is an easy to operate, fairly sturdy device, but in my opinion is way over priced for what you get. And that isn't the main issue. The problems started after I had it for a few months. I would plug it into the my computer and it would not register as a connected device. It would charge and show the battery screen on the Walkman but the computer couldn't detect it. I had to plug it in and unplug is several times to get it to work. Then it stopped registering no matter what I did. I wondered if my computer driver was corrupted..even though it worked fine on other devices.  When I bought a new laptop and tried to connect it again...same problem. It would charge but fail to go to the screen that showed it was being detected so I could not load music. It would instead either attempt to play a song or go to the charge screen without registering on the computer. I went into settings and used ""restore factory settings"". It made no difference. I then used the hard reset on the unit in hopes that would work. No go. If these were not priced so outrageously I might chalk this up to a bad unit and buy another, but for what you get...and with the issues I have had....not worth it."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"I can only blame myself for not looking through the negative reviews on this bra. Everything that people said is true.
The bra is cheap looking from thin cotton fabric. Really not intended for sizes bigger than C cup. Also might be uncomfortably tight for sizes over 36.  I ordered XL (I'm 38D -38DD) and this is definitely way too small. It's also uncomfortable tight around my chest so no way I can wear it at night.
For the poor quality it's clearly overpriced as well. I feel fooled by trusting Medela brand to have some understanding of a breastfeeding woman's anatomy.
The return policy is not mentioned anywhere and I made another mistake trusting that it would be something similar to amazon's - i.e, free return on clothing that is in unused condition. Well, silly of me. There is a 20% re-stocking fee, plus you have to pay shipping costs. Together this will come for me to about 7-8$ at least, half of the bra's price. Not to mention that I'll have to find time to go to the post office to send it (not something you are looking forward to when you just had a baby). Otherwise why would you shop online if you can go to the store to find bra that fits?
While I understand the reasons behind the return policy on things bought from a third party through Amazon, I wish I was better informed about it before I spent money on this bra."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"I have a 15-pound red kettlebell from GoFit.  At the time I am writing this review, you don't seem to be able to select that combination of options on Amazon, but that may change in the future as things come into and/or go out of stock.  And much of what I say will apply to any of the GoFit kettlebells that are currently being offered.

At any rate, I am very happy with this kettlebell.  It is comfortable to hold and I like the vinyl coating (not on the handle, just on the colored part as seen in the product images).  I have had my kettlebell for at least 5 or 6 years and have used it periodically and the coating does not seem to degrade.  It basically still looks the same as the day I got it.  I have not had any problems with this kettlebell slipping in my hands, either.

15 pounds is a little bit of a challenge for me and I can't use this kettlebell for every kettlebell exercise that I do.  I also have a smaller one for some exercises, and switch out as needed.  If you are planning to get into kettlebell training at a serious level, you will probably want to have a few kettlebells of different weights.  I find that a kettlebell workout works the legs more than you might expect (you don't notice it at the time but you feel it the next day).  For reference, if it helps in terms of selecting a kettlebell weight for you, I'm a small-framed woman in my mid-30s and I'd consider myself intermediate/advanced when it comes to most home exercise programs.

The DVD that came with this was not really a complete workout.  However, I thought the instructor (Sarah Lurie) was good and it motivated me to buy a couple of her full-length workout DVDs (many are available here on Amazon)."

Kindle_Store_5,0,"When a lie gets blown out of proportion, could anything good possibly come out of it?

Lacey Weston had her reasons for wanting to leave Brisbane where she was attending design school and go back home to Jumbuck Springs.  But when she got home, her brothers wanted her to turn around and go right back.

Cooper Grainger used to be Lacey's bother Ethan's partner and he was asked to keep an eye on Lacey while she was away from home and in school.  She might need someone's help and her brothers wouldn't be there for her.  When Lacey comes to him the night after she breaks up with her boyfriend and says she wants to go home, Coop takes her.

Coop didn't plan on getting caught up in the middle of a family mess, but when he saw them gang up on Lacey, he had to step in.  Lacey had lied about being pregnant so her brothers would let her stay home. When they demanded to know who the father was, Coop said it was him to put an end to the discussion and so they would leave Lacey alone.

Lacey quickly becomes popular in her home town after she reconstructs a damaged wedding gown for a friend and the story makes it in a magazine.  When dream job is presented to Lacey, she can't say no, even if it means leaving her home town and Coop behind and moving to Melbourne.  She has to tell her brothers the truth about not being pregnant so she can take on this new job.  But what will happen to the relationship Lacey and Coop have started during the time they have been living together?

Sometimes you have to let go of who you love so they can be all they are meant to be.

This steamy story is one not to be missed.  Lacey and Coop were meant to be together even though Coop was a lot older than Lacey.  The passion they shared was intense. I can't wait to read the next books in this series."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,Very Cute. Nice and thick material. Fit as expected and great color.
Books_5,0,"The storyline alternates between primarily two perspectives (a blind French girl and a German orphan boy) and timeframes until everything all comes together as France is being liberated from Germany at the end of WWII.

The prose is beautiful, and really places you the moment. It was particularly interesting to read from Marie-Laure's perspective, since, being blind, the way she would describe scenes was a very unique take. I also really enjoyed the way it portrayed WWII. This was not good vs evil, it was just two people who happened to be on two different sides of the war and were doing everything they could to survive. You feel connected with each character, which is hard to do when you know they are ultimately meant to be enemies. It's a really endearing and touching historical fiction account of WWII.

My only criticism would be the ending. Since the chapters are very short and the timeline constantly moving around, you get the sense that it's building to a huge climax. Personally, I found that climax to be a bit anti-climactic. But overall, that detracted very little from my enjoyment of the novel and would recommend to anyone who enjoys historical fiction, WWII, or well-written literature."
Movies_and_TV_5,0,"Bruce Willis did his best work here and the rest of the cast was excellent as well. As good as this film is, it's unfortunate that all M. Night's subsequent work was unfavorably compared to it.  I can recommend ""Unbreakable""(also starring Willis) as the same kind of mystery with a ""drop jaw"" ending."

Kindle_Store_5,0,This is an amazing story. I really liked the characters. I am hoping to read the whole series. I am into the romance novels and there are not many that are with detective novels mixed in.
Kindle_Store_5,1,Short but definatly worth the read. The characters were well developed and kept my interest.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"First off: the footbed is wonderful for my P.F. prone feet. Feels REALLY good right from the moment I put them on.
Second: These run wide. I have a foot that is B when not swollen (at the high end of B width) and C width when swollen (and I get swelling with some regularity). So, if you have a narrow foot, the very last closure of ankle and at toes is not gonna be narrow enough, and if you run a slender B width (slender end of that range), you'll likely find this very loose. I found it loose.
Third: the ankle strap is slightly irritating on the inner ankle, slightly.
Fourth: The front strap (adjustable) is a little irritating outer edge of the foot. This might be due to roughness in the strap, or even due to the looseness. I put it on the tightest adjustment, and it was slightly loose. That may have led to the rubbing aspect.

But that footbed! Wow, if they could perfect the sizing issues I read about and the adjustments, this could be perfect. The footbed is a dream of support for my arch and heel cup nestling.

I hesitated a while before plunking down 139 for shoes. If my feet hadn't been super-achey this month, no way. I still wonder why it is so pricey given the quality control issues (sizing issues, strap looseness in some styles, etc). But I ordered this in black and have ordered the tan, too. Despite the irritation of straps, the coddling of my soles is preicous, and when my upperfoot aches (the bones), having less constriction as this style provides helps.

The style is a bit matronly, so don't expect the height of fashion. Just nice support and comfort for troubled soles."

Even the lusty stuff seemed juvenile and silly. Lizzy and Diesel reminded me of Joe and Stephine. They were the same characters with the same dynamics. And what was up with the monkey?

I had a lot of trouble feeling sorry for her; shes an adulteress who gets it toss right back at her with a vengeance and in the most ugly and embarrassing way.  Then theres Gloria who definitely garnered sympathy...and their stories are woven in a fascinating way.  And in the end the triumph over all of the nastiness that their husband created.  Its worth a read and I kept turning pages to see how it all unfolded.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"I am a writer, and the room where I work is always colder in winter than the rest of the house. I got tired of wrapping myself up like a Christmas present in order to keep warm while working. Heat Storm to the rescue!

Pros:
Wide stance and very stable - will not be knocked over if bumped accidentally.
LIghtweight, large handle on top - can be easily picked up and moved
Fan is relatively quiet, and not annoying
Has a high-power and low-power setting, so energy usage can be controlled (changes fan speed from high to low)
Comes pre-set at 70F, but the settings can be easily adjusted
Does not have a ""hot smell"" odor when in use (at least so far)
Best of all, it does indeed heat a fairly large room quickly and efficiently.  The manufacturer says it will heat up to 1000 square feet.  My room is larger than that, and it heats the area just fine.

Update:  The more I use this heater, the more I like it. Infrared heat is the same kind of heat we get from the sun. Instead of trying to heat the whole room, I now place the heater about six feet away from my work area, point it in the direction of my chair, and run it on the low power setting. The result is a gentle heat, much like sitting in a pool of sunshine on a beautiful spring day. Lovely.

Description of how an infrared heater works, from a commercial heater company (biosmart solutions):
""An infrared heater operates differently from a conventional space heater in that the infrared heat waves heat the body and objects of the room directly. The heat stays evenly distributed and the room retains the heat longer. In contrast, conventional heaters heat by first raising the temperature of the air within the room, which in turn heats you.""

Cons:
None so far

I have only had this heater for a short time, so its long-term durability is still unknown.  Very happy with this product so far!"

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"I am extremely large-busted and was in search of a ""miracle"" bra to solve several problems I have with most bras.

1) My everyday bras with underwire were always poking, chafing and causing a rash.
2) Exercise was difficult since no bra supported me well enough to prevent bounce.
3) I needed a bra to sleep in for extra support but didn't want to buy a ton of bras just for that purpose.

The Fiona bra has come closer than any other I've tried at meeting my needs.  The material is soft and absorbent with no underwire, and yet I feel better supported (for everyday wear) than I did in a Bali underwire bra.  It moves with my body, absorbs sweat, and doesn't chafe or poke me anywhere, so it's very comfortable to sleep in.  It's also supportive enough for low-impact exercise; however, it is NOT supportive enough to prevent bounce while jogging or during other high-impact exercise.  Maybe that's just not a possibility for me and someone a little smaller would have better luck.  I should mention that I'm wearing this bra in size 44DD and that it's actually a little small in the cup area.  Fortunately, it launders well.  I haven't found any change in the bra's size or shape from putting it through my washer and dryer.

One other negative is that the bra looks like a sports bra with wide straps and seams running along the sides.  This is fine except for the fact that it makes it a little difficult to wear the bra under all tops as an everyday bra.  Depending on the cut of the top and the material, either the straps or the seams or both will sometimes show through.  This is annoying but not enough of an issue to make me stop using this bra for daily wear.

Overall, I find the bra to be excellent for my full figure.  Although it's not quite my ""miracle"" bra, I still plan to buy more of these."

Electronics_5,0,This clock is so cute and durable. I got it for my little girl so it would teach her responsibility in getting up on her own. I love the pink color and how it lights up pink. The covering is pink silicone. You set the time with the two buttons on top and it has the alarm set button on the left side use the hour and minutes buttons along with the alarm set button to set the alarm. You can use the button on the right side to cut the alarm off and on. It also has a snooze light button on top so you can see the time better in the dark. Push the button and the clock will illuminate for about 5 seconds so you can see the time. It runs on 3 AAA batteries (not included). Thank you for taking time to read my review :)

How else could you explain getting a pair of episodes that was mainly soap suds.  Now I think the series needed this slow down to allow our heroes time to reflect on relationships, but will someone please smack Inuyasha!  Inuyasha basically said it himself that all his feelings for Kikyo are revolving around guilt and obligation because Kikyo died for him.  He feels it's necessary to give his life for her at the very least.  Please, the girl pulled a knife on him while they were embracing and even said he was like Naraku in his feelings toward her.  How many more evil things does this dead priestess have to do before he gets a clue that the Kikyo he fell in love with is no longer going by that name?"

I will probably just buy a new one, as it is cheaper, but it will be great for my dog. I bought this for a friend who has a small dog who is about 6 months old. She loved it and we adopted her. It fits perfectly in her crate and she is comfortable in it."

I ordered this to add to my collection of awesome figures for my son's birthday party. The figure was very well made and very well made. He loved it. The face looks really nice and he enjoys playing with it. He loved it and put it together. The face is very soft and cuddly and I like that it is made of a soft material. It is cute.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"We've all seen it...the mess in the trunk or under the seat.  For some reason wires just naturally find their way into nots, and having big heavy cable clamps on the ends doesn't help matters much.  Add to that the fact that your car won't start and your mood is deteriorating fast!  It's a recipe for disaster!  Well no longer!  Some finally invented something to save us from our frustrations.  The Arsenal cable organizer.

I bought a set of 25' Coleman 4ga Booster Cables with it and they fit without a problem!  So just about any jumper cable size and length combo should prove to work as well.  There are two sleve style compartments on the sides.  Good perhaps for a set of flat tools such as a wrench or plyers or good for gloves.  The stiching on the handles is top to bottom so I don't fear those coming loose.  The zippers are good heavy stock so they should last as well.

One more word of advice save the twist ties that come with your cables, and if they don't come with them get some.  Twist tying them before storage will help the bag keep them nice, neat, and flat.  And the bag will keep those monster clamps from hooking everything around them!

Update: I just bought a second bag and a set of Coleman 25' 2ga cables.  They fit great!  So buy this bag with confidence for just about any cable size and length combo you can find!!!"

I needed something that would stop that behavior, and this worked well.  It only took a few times of using it, and now I can just show them the can, and they'll stop.  It just emits the sound of compressed air, which they don't enjoy.  It fits easily in my pocket to keep handy for when I need it.

Kindle_Store_5,0,"I've read the series from book #1 ... and enjoyed as a series of light / quick reads.  There is a decent plot line and the story does move well.  Unfortunately, the editing, spelling, grammar, consistency of names, etc. is absolutely deplorable.  I feel Jaden Skye has an excellent talent for coming up with the series / story plot, but clearly cannot edit or word process his own work.

Jaden:  Hire an editor!

I have found errors in many Kindle Books that I've read ... perhaps one maybe two in a given publication.  And I can live with that.  But not like this.

Amazon should do something ... require a standard level of text quality or require an author to pay Amazon for an edit check prior to publishing.  AMAZON SHOULD BE ASHAMED TO SELL THIS QUALITY LEVEL.

Part of me is sorry that I bought the whole series."

The touchpad is not responsive in many areas, especially around the edges. you do not know how frustrating it is to be click and nothing happens. there is no sound or visual indicator that a click was successful. also the keyboard is too small. sorry i love chromebooks and we desperately needed an ips 1080 display at a reasonable price point, but this touchpad, and to a lesser extent the small keyboard, ruin the experience

Arrived a day early, and font varied from some pictures I saw posted. Name seems a little squished on the tag, however the phone number is large and very legible (which is the most important part!). Looks really nice on the collar, my only regret is that I should of gotten the darker pink."
Kindle_Store_5,0,"I enjoyed Dead Running very much. It had a great combination of action, romance, and witty dialogue.  There definitely were some obvious plot twists and turns but that just added to the book's charm- it was a fluffier suspense book with plenty of fun occurrences and tame romance to really engage the reader. I liked all the characters too which was a plus.

A couple of things for me that kept it from being a five star:  the ending did not have full closure, so I am assuming that there will have to be a follow-up book(s), otherwise everything is left to the imagination. That was a bummer. Second while the book was fun and I liked all the characters, Cassie was sometimes very immature. Her actions made me cring a few times.  It also annoyed me that for a person with a degree in the fitness and health industry, she did not really know her craft. Kind of made me feel like she was a bit of a dough-head and I did not want to feel that way about her.

Overall a great read if you are in the mood for something not so serious- a fun romantic suspense."

Pet_Supplies_5,0,"I bought the PIF00 primary kit and the extra transmitter for my Shepard. I bought the extra transmitter due to the large yard.
The items (other than the test light) themselves appeared to be quality construction.
When I started putting out the flags, using the test light was hit or miss.  I'd plant a flag then move back and start heading outward again 10 to the side.  In some places the circumference was ok.  On others, it wasn't equidistant from the main unit (I started with the single main unit).  So, when the circle was done, I had a semi circle of flags with some at a different radius than others.  While that would have been ok - the dog would just have a non perfect circle...  However, when I went back to check again, the test light lit up at different radii than the original layout.  Basically, the dog might get zapped at a location today where he was fine yesterday.  Not something I'm willing to risk.
The test light has 2 thin wire contacts that started to bend and in my opinion would eventually break.  I had to wiggle the test light on the collar's contacts to make sure they touched.
Your mileage may vary if you buy and deploy this system.
The return process was smoother than I expected.  So hopefully if you try this product (great system and I may have received a bad test light) and it doesn't work, it's not $600 down the drain."
Kindle_Store_5,1,"This review is for one of the free books in this series.  This is the first book in the series.  The second book is also free.

This is a short story with a lot of sexual tension.  The story is told in two parts.  The first part is a fast paced story.  The second part is a more mature story.  I liked it a lot.  The story is told from the POV of the main character, Luke, who is a vampire hunter.  The sex scenes are very hot.  I liked that the main character, Luke, was a bit of a jerk, but it didn't bother me that he had a big heart.  The story was a bit different from the first book in the series.  I will be reading the first book in the series.

This book was a good read.  I really enjoyed it.  I was not disappointed in this book.  It was a good story.  It is about a good guy, but also about a bad guy.  The characters were well written.  I was very excited to read the next book.  This is the second book in the series.  I really liked this book.  It is about a good guy, but also about a bad guy.  I was glad to see that"

Noam Chomsky is brilliant in explaining in detail of the abuse by the Corporation and government manipulating and the consequences. How lucky we are also still to be alive with decisions that were made from the past to present. But what is, more importantly, is what was said to overcome these degradations by uniting the people together, in which Noam Chomsky speak off by taking responsibilities as an advocate for Humanity, Global warning, and education, etc.  This book is a recommendation for all to read including his other book or video, Requiem for the American Dream."

The strap across the foot is also ajustable for making just the right fit.

There were definitely surprises throughout which I thoroughly enjoyed.  What didn't I like about this book?  The intimate scenes were almost painful, very hokey.  I would love to read more from this author, but would have to skip over the ""sizzling"" scenes as they just make me cringe."
Kindle_Store_5,0,"Excellent ending to the series. Sometimes you read a group of books and get to the end and think ""meh; I spent all that time reading for this?"" Not the case here. Storylines are wrapped up and all the appropriate people live happily ever after. So perhaps a tad unrealistic, but this is just the kind of escapism I look for in my summer reading and the humor and great writing that are prevalent in all the books makes them a must-read and one of my highly recommended summer reads."

It's great because the shapes are simple, so they're easy to fit into their correct places.  Plus, the magnet feature helps your child get the cookie into the hole - once they have it close, the magnets pull the cookie into place.  And then, of course, music plays and lights go off ... great positive reinforcement!  The cookies sit into place on either side and the toy still recognizes them.  The gingerbread man (only a button) sings and lights up when pushed.  There are also 2 settings for this toy - a musical setting and a learning setting.  That's great because this toy really grows with your child!  This toy is another fantastic product from Fisher Price!"

Books_5,0,"An Amish Family Christmas is a perfect series conclusion and a wonderful Christmas read. Its about transformation and loving relationships anchored in faith. After the way Levi had reacted to his fathers death in an earlier book, it was great to see his return to the family. But sometimes coming back isn't easy, as many readers have undoubtedly experienced, and Levis struggles to fit in ring true. He just blossoms as the relationship with Julia and her daughter develops, fulfilled by being needed.

With its focus on some of the grittier aspects of life, such as death and physical abuse, this story shows that the Amish face the same life struggles that we do. I loved the way serious issues are offset by everyday life and even humor. And I have to say that one of my favorite things about An Amish Family Christmas is spending more time with Simon, a character who touched me greatly.

Levis personal growth and Julia learning to trust make this a moving story  with a fabulous conclusion filled with Christmas cheer. I loved the whole series and highly recommend it to all who enjoy Amish fiction.

I had to return it due to the fact that it was just a cheap replacement. I used it for two weeks and it held up very well. The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because I really like the sizing.

Movies_and_TV_5,0,"I simply can't understand the vitriol that has been heaped on this movie.  I didn't see Alexander in the theatre, so my only experience with it is the director's cut DVD, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  Oliver Stone brought Alexander and his times to life for me, and Colin Farrell did an excellent job putting a human face on a man who thought he was a god.  Don't be put off by the jabs of spoiled movie critics - watch this lavish and engrossing film, and enjoy!

The only flaw I saw with the film - and it may be an insurmountable one - is that so much went on in Alexander's life, that it is probably impossible to present it all in a single movie.  Stone gives us a glimpse into the political, military, and personal aspects of Alexander's story, and these really can't be fully appreciated unless one has first familiarized oneself by reading the various accounts of Alexander, especially those written by his ancient biographers.  I may be reading too much into it, but I think the central theme of the Stone film is given us when, on Alexander's wedding night, he responds to his new bride""s question about whether he loves Hephaestion by saying, ""There are many kinds of love, Roxane.""  Oliver Stone's Alexander has many loves - his father, his mother, Hephaestion, Bagoas, the army, glory, war, his vision of a united world empire - and his attempts to give full devotion to each one drive his extraordinary career and, it would seem, eventually lead to his own self-destruction."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"Ok so the trickiest step was step one.
the hardest step was step four
the most annoying step was assembling the drawers.

They said you would need two people to assemble it but i did it by myself. Let me tell you something, if you are stubborn enough or skilled enough or have the right tools you can do just about anything. I didn't have the right tools so i will let you guys decide on whether i am stuborn or skilled.

Assembly took about 2 hours. The piece, once assembled, is very solid. I expect many many years of use from this. The casters are also very nice too and the whole thing rolls with ease even when you add weight.

Why four stars. Well it is a series of small details. Some of the shelf pin holes are too big and the shelf pins just fall out. One of the door panels was build with the dark color facing out and the other with the dark color facing in. but probably the work part is that some of the pieces are warped. Nothing major but its enough that i can see it and it annoys me."

I couldn't relate to their spoiled mannerisms and lazy lifestyle. But I kept reading because I felt that something, a shocking twist maybe, was going to occur eventually. Yet when it finally happened, it wasn't much. In fact, the twist was ridiculous and senseless. I gave the book three stars because it did at least hold my interest, which some novels are incapable of doing. Lockhart definitely has potential."

It's a small office and so we are have constant contact with each other and I have found it hard to strike the right balance between friend and boss. Many times I have felt uncomfortable when wanting to address something with one of my employees. This book has been invaluable to me in that it has given me a lot to think about and put into action. I like that there is a timeline so there are different questions to ask myself each day so that I just don't do a 180 in 24 hours. My employees may just walk out on me then!

This book really made me identify to myself why I am the boss, what skills I possess to help this business and to take ownership of that. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to work on their management skills!

An Inescapable Attraction is an engaging western romance that is set in the time period following the Civil War, but before the turn of the century. Through her descriptive writing, Sydney Jane Baily has done a superb job of bringing each character, and their surroundings to life. Her characters are not perfect, and there are moments that they are not even very likable. However, through all of Ellie and Thaddeus' trials and tribulations, both not only mature, but they each work out their differences and come to loving trust that will insure their HEA.

I really liked this book. Granted, the sexual content was descriptive, but it was not graphic. That said, I would have enjoyed it much more without the religious expletives.

I had a lot of fun with this book and I'm sure it will be worth the read.  Highly recommend it.I absolutely loved this book! I was given this book by a friend in exchange for an honest review.  I loved it!  It has great characters and plot twists.  I highly recommend it!  It was an awesome read!  I can't wait to read more from this author.  I love reading about people who are just getting their start in their lives.  I love the story line and characters.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys romance and to everyone who enjoys a good mystery story.  I highly recommend it!  Thank you!  I have read the entire series and can't wait to read more from"
Pet_Supplies_5,1,"5 stars because the product looks and feels good.  I will keep this for the next couple of months.My dogs love this food.  My dog eats it twice a day and he seems to like it.  I think it will be better for him to eat it once in a while.  I have a German Shepherd and a German Shepherd mix and these are the only foods I feed my dogs.  I highly recommend these to any dog owner.Love this toy for my dog!  He is a chewer so I will buy this again for him.  He loves to chew on it and he is so happy with it!My dogs love this toy!  They play with it until they are bored, but my boys can't hold it.  I've had it for a while now and it is still very useful for my dogs.My dog loves this food and I was very pleased with the quality. She will eat it with her teeth removed. She is a small dog and she is a senior dog. She eats everything except this. I don't know if it is a nutrition issue, but it is a good food for my dog and I can't say enough about it.My dog is very picky and this is the only thing she has not gone for. It is super soft and she loves it. I love that it is made in the USA. She loves to play tug with it and she is a little piggie and loves to pull and pull. It is her favorite toy but I can't imagine that it is getting too much use. The only thing I would not recommend is that the material is not sturdy enough to"
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"I bought the x-large, as it was cheaper than the large at the time, so figured, why not?  This thing is seriously massive and heavy; too large and heavy for my chocolate lab to comfortably hold in her mouth.  She doesn't show much interest in it, but I'm not sure if it is the design/flavor, or just the massiveness of it; however, if you have a strong-chewer, you can't beat Nylabones!  They are nearly indestructible.  I still have some from 2 labs ago...that's about 20+ years a few of these bones have lasted!  I have NEVER had to throw one away because it was chewed up.  Only had to replace them because others have been lost.  P.S. - if your dog has this in its mouth standing near your feet, you'd better be wearing steel-toed boots!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,"This hub replaces my original one. The only difference is that it comes with a small screw driver.

I had to replace the crank with the new one, so it should work better.

The only thing I'm not happy about is the price. I ordered the full size and it's just a bit too small. I'd be more inclined to order the larger size. I just can't get it to fit my AR.

I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.I use this for my cycling training. I usually use this to keep my blood flow in check and helps my muscles relax. I also use it for my work out as well. I have to keep it in my pack for my work out. I will be buying another one for my home gym.This is a good product.  It is small and compact, but well made.  It is very comfortable.  I use it to hang a 5-foot pole in the garage.  I have been using it for several months now and it seems to be doing great.  I would recommend this product.I bought these for my husband for his birthday. He loved them! They were perfect for his needs. He also loves the colors and the size. He will definitely order more!Very nice and well made.  I bought them for my husband's birthday and he loves them.  The quality is good.I've had a few of these knives before, this one is my favorite. It is a very good knife and I have used them for a few years. The blade is very sharp and has a nice feel to it. It has a very solid sheath"
Kindle_Store_5,0,Excellent book. I loved the characters and the premise. The writing was spot on. My only problem was it was too short! I want more! Thank goodness the other two books in this series are out and winging their way to my Kindle even as I type this.

Kindle_Store_5,1,"I have been patiently waiting for this book to come out.  I was really hoping for a little more from this author.  I think that is the reason I gave it 4 stars.  It was hard to get into the book.  I would have liked to see more from the other characters.  I love the way they are portrayed.  They are a strong, independent, and very mature couple.  I really enjoyed the way they acted together.  I love how they both have their own baggage.  I am glad that they are able to let go of their past and move on with their lives.  I was a little disappointed with the ending.  I was hoping that it would have been a bit longer.  It would have been a bit longer had it been a little longer.  It was a really good read.

This started out as a slightly depressing story- Atwood's wife cheats on him, his in-laws (mother/father/brother) live with them and take complete advantage of him, his job's in jeopardy. The best thing his wife could have done for him was get him hooked up with the All American Studs crew, where he's finally able to realize what makes him happy.

Trailer Park Abe is a quick read, but there's a lot packed into this short story...I was disgusted by his wife and her family, frustrated with the way they treated him and how he let himself be treated, but glad when he decided enough was enough.

Working for AAS made him open his eyes to who he really is, and that made all the difference for him. Meeting Reece was probably the best thing that could have happened to him, and I am looking forward to more of their story.

***One thing that did bother me a bit, you can definitely tell the author isn't American as there were quite a few words and phrases that didn't make sense for a story that was taking place in the US. It didn't really detract from the story but did throw me for a loop."
Movies_and_TV_5,1,"This is an indy flick that has the potential to be a classic.  The acting is pretty good.  The story is interesting, but the acting is not.  The only other thing that I would say is that this film is very enjoyable.  This is a great movie for the whole family.  I highly recommend it.I had to have this DVD for my husband.  He was quite surprised with the quality of it.  It was all a good experience for him.  He is now hooked on the series.  I love the characters.  They are all very funny and it's a great show.  The actors are all very good.  I am very happy with this purchase.This movie was okay. It was good for the heart and for the family. It was also good for the kids. I think I would have given it 5 stars if I had not watched it.I really enjoyed this movie. It was good, and the ending was a little disappointing. I just wish they had made more episodes.I didn't see it on TV when I was a kid, but I found it to be a fun, scary and suspenseful movie.  It's a family film, and if you're a fan of the genre, you will love it.  A really fun movie that shows just how well the British accent can be accentuated.  It's a very fun movie to watch, and a little too long, but it's worth the time.  I recommend it to anyone who's looking for something that's not too scary and suspenseful.I liked this movie because I thought it was so funny, but it was a little too"
Pet_Supplies_5,0,I loved this item. The design is nice. The colors work together well. Its most definitely good quality and made to last a long time. My puppy didn't have any issues with putting it on or wearing it. He was really chill and comfortable. He never tried getting it off or biting at it. Not even once. Although I will say I do wish there was a zipper or a button or just something on the part that goes around the neck. My puppy did not enjoy getting it off. I honestly think it hurt him a bit. So since I took it off I haven't decided if I will ever put it back on. Other than that its a great quality item.
Movies_and_TV_5,0,"This movie to me was and is amazing. I saw it (rented it) and then bought it so I could watch it over several times. I read a negative review of it (by a professional critic I think) who said the first part was good, well made, but the 2nd part was not. This person missed the whole point.  First she gave the twist in the story so anyone reading the critique would not have this surprise and then she missed a lot of the undertones in the 2nd part. For instance she said ""he meets a young girl who happens to be a butoh dancer and that happens to be what his wife wanted to be"". That says it all, how the person misunderstood the whole story.  In fact the person goes to Japan to find the answer to the death  he cannot accept and in the first part we see his wife at a butoh performance in Berlin, the two parts of the movie tie in exactly. Also there is a clear analysis or how people view and deal with death in the east and the west. The young girl (the butoh dancer in Tokyo) has lost her mother and there is a poignant scene where she compares her mother to a duck (!! up and down, up and down) and gives a very sharp clue as to her mother's death. Also she has been rendered homeless from this death, her situation is quite desperate but in fact she deals with death so much better than our character who is trying to understand his loss from a western point of view.  This movie was a seminal event for me, maybe because I have had some losses in my family and am a dancer but it provoked a terrific surge of creativity , This movie also made me very happy in many ways..and it's beautiful. Just beautiful."

Kindle_Store_5,0,"My introduction to Sophia Henry and her Pilots series was through Power Play. Gaby and Landon had a meaty story but there was a disconnect for me. So I decided to try again with Interference. Ms. Henry is consistent in her willingness to tackle subjects that are painful. From the beginning she delivers that one, two punch. Complex people facing their demons and working to overcome them. Jason has baggage that has followed him into adulthood. From abandonment and trust issues, to an attraction that pulls the scab off a partially healed wound. Linden has worked to become a responsible young woman. An act of rebellion in her teens left her with more responsibility than she expected and the shame of disappointment. Interference redeemed Sophia Henry in my eyes. Sympathy, empathy and hope are the stepping stones to an amazing and inspirational story."
Books_5,0,"Michael Crichton continues to explore the front edge of speculative fiction in Next, which reads like slices of life turned upside down by the availability of genetic engineering. Crichton explores many facets in parallel stories, bringing in a cast of dozens of characters--many of whom aren't burdened with ethical compass or morals to object to the growing invasiveness of advances, disregarding the physical dangers, and setting perilous precedents that could impact all life on the planet.

Next reads as a morality tale, where virtually every turn is for the worse. Vignettes interplay and rush toward a climax that puts characters on the same page, even if they seem to be thrown together for the convenience of tying loose plot lines. But the real story is a plot of themes. What are the consequences of manipulating complex systems of which man has the slightest knowledge? Just because it's possible, do we have the right to play God in the creative process? Can we foretell the results in emergent research that identifies a single variable in a chain of processes that interact in ways we've barely begun to comprehend? Crichton lays out a case for caution, without turning the book into a pulpit.

The stories in Next were compelling examples looking into the abuses of science. Although stories of talking animals (an African Gray parrot, a foul-mouthed multi-lingual orangutan, and a humanpanzee adopted into family life) were reminders that we're reading fiction, even if several of the story lines borrow from actual cases of genetic precedent. Next shows a causality of legal challenges and life implications of ignoring the dangers of unbridled creative power."

I found myself repeating the same things over and over and over.  I really didn't care for the main character, and I think that was one of the biggest problems I had with this novel.

I would suggest this book to anyone who wants to be a part of a wonderful story that will continue to grow as Robb writes more books. This story is a well-known formula that still hold true to making an amazing story. The mystery and build up are on par you cannot go wrong. This story will be just as relevant in 5 years as it is today that is the power of good storytelling and being able to set a story setting that the background that stays immersive but without making it over saturated.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,"I got this seat for my wife and she loves it. She also loves the seat and the fact that it is a seat, not a seat-line, so it is adjustable. She is still happy with it, but she is not going to use it."
Electronics_5,0,"I purchased 3 of them with great expectations.  Using supplied sortware, I got only one camera on my computer, and could not get the other 2 on with it. At set up, I tried using: first Wireless and later with cable 5e.  Just could not get them to work all together. I gave up and they are sitting unplugged in the corner for over 2 months.

Anyway, when you can get all 3 on supplied software on my PC, instructions want you to go into the Router security system's guts and change access for external viewing. We depend on the router for our living, working from home when away from office, and we dare not tamper with the internal setting of our router and risk loss of work and income.  A big mysterious disappointment.

I may buy another router, taking our main router off line , and trying to get the cameras to work with a 2nd router.  If I mess up internet connection  with that 2nd router (while trying open access on the 2nd router for internet viewing) I can always take the 2nd router off-line and plug back in our old, great working, reliable router. I may try that next month.

My friend got one camera to work in his home, but he did a work around requiring his home computer to be on all the time when he wants home viewing while away from his laptop."

Also, it's not a real icebreaker, but it's a fun ice breaker.  It's a very different set of icebreakers from the ones on Amazon.  It's very similar to the ""sea of stars"" set, but with a twist.  It's actually a different set of icebreakers, and the real one is different from the real one.  It's a different set of icebreakers, and the real one is different from the real one.  I think it's a good deal if you get it.

Overall, I'd say this set is a good deal, but not a perfect deal.  I've used this set on a lot of different icebreakers, and it's still worth it.  However, it's not a great deal.  If you have a kid, this is a great buy.  But if you're a kid, this is not a great deal.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"I don't know why I never thought of this before!  How convenient is it to have your mat carrying sling double as your strap?  This will be great for taking my outdoor yoga class at the farmers market.  I don't like to bring props with me but sometimes I wish I had a strap with me to get a deeper stretch - Im just not as flexible as those college girls! As a sling I love that it is so adjustable.  It will fit all of my mats no matter how thick, and sometimes I like to roll my blanket up in my mat when I go, so that makes them too thick for my cheap elastic slings.  Its easy to use as a sling, although it doesnt feel like the straps cinch too tight around the mat when I put it on.  They are plenty tight when Im carrying it though.

It is nice and sturdy as a strap too.  Its easy to unloop the carrying loops to convert it into a strap.  There are included instructions on how to convert it, but I didn't really understand them so I just fiddled around until I found something that worked.  I prefer straps with d-rings like this, and I found it to be a great length for a strap.  It seems nice and sturdy.  It doesnt slip through my hand and feels really supportive for my stretches.  Also a nice bonus - I like the color a lot.  It even matches my favorite yoga mat!  Im very happy with this strap/sling!

Movies_and_TV_5,0,"First off, Who names these movies ? My gosh...
Very funny vignettes of male lead trying to find true love, Or at least Normal love.
Can't get over that title, When you watch the movie, And you should it has girls and romance and funny bits thru out,You will wonder ""WHY or Why ?"" Did they name it that...
Matthew James ( Merl  on ANGEL  tv series) is very likable and makes sense out of this love-starved artist role and has some good luck in bed too.
Sadie Katz (AB Buddy spokesmodel ) has A DEMI MOORE-esque vibe and seems a whole person in character,Not someone off a written page.
Jacqui Holland has an uncredited role as a sidewalk pickup, She and her tattoo make some very funny moments early on in film.
So, Icky title, Great premise and actors capable of making it almost 'sweet romance'."

Pet_Supplies_5,1,I live in the Willamette area of the US and these are a nice size for the size of the tank. I had to replace a couple of these around the house to get them to work properly. I have been using these for a few years now and I don't see any difference with the bubbles. I have a German Shepherd and a German Shepherd mix and these are the only things I have used that have worked for them. I am very pleased with this product. I am very pleased with this product.

I received a free copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.I love reading about the lives of the young women who were on the train with a group of young men in the middle of nowhere.

The plastic parts are also very basic and not nearly as strong as the plastic parts. The rubber parts are a little bit thicker than the rubber parts, but they're still pretty strong. The rubber parts are also very durable and have a good feel to them. They are a bit more expensive than the rubber parts, but they're still very good quality."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"I like and admire cats, but I'm a dog person. And I've never been fond of cleaning up after indoor cats. We had a couple of cats through the years when kids were little, and of course, I did the clean-up. So secretly, I was not thrilled when I agreed to take my daughter's sweet rescued cat to live with me because she had so little room in her NYC apartment. I knew what was in the future. Lots of mess.  I don't mind the scooping.  To me, the biggest annoyance about cat litter is the gritty cat litter scattered on the floor.  There is nothing worse then walking bare-foot into invisible cat litter spread on the floor.

We needed a new cat litter box here so after reading more than I wanted to know about the various options, I picked this one instead of the hooded kind, and I am SO glad I did.

I chose the open design because it is so much easier to just scoop and clean it more often.  There is no odor when you clean it daily and it only takes a minute with this design. A closed litter box is too easy to ignore.

This thing is well-engineered:

Most of the litter stays in the box.
It's effortless to reach down into it to scoop and clean.
Very easy to clean.
Anti-microbial without any chemical odors.
Holds a boatload of litter.
Tucks into a corner.

Since buying it, the litter mess hasn't vanished but it's 90% better. And I am getting attached to the new feline member of the household too.  I recommend this product whole-heartedly!"

No hose (which costs about $22 at local store) and nothing for it to hang from or connect it to the shower pipe (which costs about $11 at store).  What?!  So, this no frills shower head ends up costing over $60 (nearly $70) when all is said and done.  No thanks...sending it back.  I'll  go get an all in one Delta or whatever."

Movies_and_TV_5,0,This was an excellent movie from start to finish. The story and the dialogue were constantly engaging. Some of the language is not widely used today but was perfect for the time and the actors were good at conveying the meaning through their expressions and tone. At the beginning of the film the main character is not very likeable and seemed to be strickly worried about society and her place in it but as the film goes on we find that she is trusting because she is trustworthy to her friends and true love. When she can clear her name she sacrifices for her true love. Even though this is a period film I found myself sympathetic to Lily's situation. Wonderful performances by all. The costumes and makeup were so good I did not recognize several actors at first. I did not care for the ending but it fit the story and any other ending would have felt contrived. I came here to buy a copy because this was one of the best movies I have seen in years.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,I gave these out for Christmas and the response was positive. It's a great gift to give dudes that doesn't cost a lot.  Pick up 5 or 6 and be ready for last minutes gifts for unexpected people.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,1,"Updated review three years later. I love the look and fit of this bra. I ordered the size 6. 5 and it fit perfectly. The fit is perfect. The only thing I would change is that the size 6. 5 is a tad bit snug. The bra straps are a little tight on the chest, but the cups are not. I like the way it looks on my son. I bought these for my husband. He loved them and they fit great. I bought this for my son for Christmas. He loved it and it was great!I'm a huge fan of the rose gold that I've bought at the top of this boot. The reason I bought this boot was because it has a lot of cushioning. I've had a few pairs of this boot and the ones that I've had have stayed on my feet well. It was very well made and was just right for my husband. He has a wide foot and this boot is perfect for that. I'm 5'4"", 130lbs and these boots are a little narrow for him. He's tall and they're a little tight on him, but he's not afraid to wear them. The material is thin and durable and the leather is very soft. I bought them for my husband and he's a bit disappointed that they didn't come up a size bigger. I'm 5'2"", 130lbs and I'm a big guy and these boots are perfect. They fit him perfectly and they're comfortable. I'd recommend these boots for any occasion."

Your stomach muscles will get a work out. We painted ours to match the other backyard items we have for the kids so everything matches perfectly together. Great investment! Well worth the money!

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,These roasting forks are awesome!  Great for all sizes of foods; marshmallows to large sausages.  The rotating and telescoping functions are wonderful.  The length is great for our small back yard fires up to bonfires on the beach.  We had a reason to contact the company and they handled our inquiry quickly.  I would definitely recommend this to others and have already done so!
Books_5,0,"What about the gunshots that the coachman heard? The  gun was found in Captain Denny's hand and brought back to Pemberley. As far as I could tell, it was never mentioned again. This was my major problem with the book - although I enjoyed reading it, I had to keep going back to keep track of the plot. So many confessions and explanations! I recommend this book for its attempt to imitate the writing style of Jane Austen, but I warn fans of P.D. James that this is far from her best work."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,Cats seemed to enjoy this and no hairballs or hacking like before.  Cheaper here than in the store but was informed no longer available so I switched to Purina One for my kitties.
Books_5,0,"After 5 novels hasn't Mr. Moody learned that you just, can't, put, a comma, wherever you want to? And at times, well, a comma is needed. This could be credited to extreme sloppiness and mistakes that editors should notice right away. Like the fact that California is 9, not 8 hours behind Amsterdam. Consecutive chapter headings of Wednesday the 10th and Thursday the 12th (with a mention of Friday the 13th) make me wonder what happened to the 11th day of that month. Mr Baker is referred to as ""Mrs"" Baker. (What the hell do editors do these days?) And there are probably others that my quick reading or fading memory have missed.
If  you have a craving for some Chet Baker (who doesn't/shouldn't?) I would suggest de Valk's bio, or pre-order Gavin's. If you have mystery fix, just buy Elmore Leonard. I am not familiar with the other works of Mr Moody, I like the idea of jazz mysteries but heavily shy away from silly clichs and most of all bad writing. If anything I hope this will turn a few people on to the lovely music of Chet Baker."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Buying an 18v drill a few years ago after doing much research I concluded that a Ryobi would suit me fine, but I have since tore the internals up.  This Milwaukee 2601 is smaller, lighter and better built.  The specs said it has more torque but I wondered if I would be able to tell the difference.  Absolutely.  I could more or less controll the Ryobi if the bit ever got stuck, but this one will twist your wrist right off.  I have to use much less effort in both drilling and driving applications, this drill does all the work.
  This milwaukee is the best in the class of compact drills with compact batteries.  This drill is a most excellent and capable tool.  It has the shortest head length of any 18v drill, it will bring 18v power to places others just can't fit.  While not being the lightest, it is the lightest to have all metal gears.  The battery lasts quite well for anything you shouldn't be using a full size maybe even hammer drill for.  A 30 min recharge time on the battery isn't the quickest, but not doing it too quickly most likely extends the battery's life.

  As to some other reviews, when considering a drill, be smart about it. Get the right tool for what you're going to be doing with it.  For anyone considering this drill, if you want a lightweight, compact yet powerful drill to reach for everytime and anytime a hammer drill isn't required, this is it.  You aren't going to be breaking into a concrete bunker with it, and it's overkill for hanging a picture but it will handle just about everything in-between."
Electronics_5,0,"This unit has a very clean low distortion rate and delivers very high quality sound, the only negitive is that is not automatic set-up and it is a little complecated to set-up.
This unit makes a very good addition to a home theater and the Harman Kardon AVR-154 delivers very good sound for theater and music buffs.
I would highly recomend it to anyone looking for a low cost but very effective system. I was and is a much better system than Sony,Phillips, Magnavox and others in it's price range."
Toys_and_Games_5,0,"Holds enough for 8 kids at a  party and so cute! Easy to fill. The only issue is you have to provide your own stick. Brooms are far too large for toddlers so we ended up taking the stick off the plunger, washing it thoroughly, and using that. lol."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,My husband and I recently purchased a Taurus 10x45 and wanted to give it a shot. We are both very happy with our purchase and have had no issues with it. The only thing we would change is to increase the rear sight size. This is an excellent product and should last us a long time. I will keep buying from Amazon.com and I will update if I find any problems.Love these gloves.  They are very comfortable and easy to wear.  I have used them in the gym and the gym.

Electronics_5,0,"This is a laptop for someone who wants large and in charge like me!  I can type easily  and not have to carry an additional keyboard because I can't stand tiny buttons.  It comes with Windows 10 already installed which was a huge plus in my book since it took my son overnight to install anything of size with our slow internet connection.  Google Chrome  downloaded quickly and I was up and running and fully charged right away.  It is heavy but I'm not a college student lugging stuff from class to class.  This will allow me to do the work I want upstairs and not run downstairs to look up phone numbers, recipes, and and stay cozy by the fire and then transport on business trips.  I do want something to cover the video chat button when not in service and love that there's an auto dust clean function."
Books_5,1,"Why do I get the word? The book is a good read. The premise of the story is simple. The main character is a social worker who has a great deal to teach young people about the importance of good work, especially when it comes to helping others. The main character is a woman who has lost her husband and is struggling to make ends meet. She has also been offered a job with a company that gives her an opportunity to help with a variety of tasks. She gets to work with a number of people who are already struggling with their job, but she still has a lot of work to do."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,A lot of people who have reviewed this talk about the extenders not being attached securely enough.  I would have to assume something has been changed on the rack because mine did have a way to tighten the extenders.  I just installed this and put one of my axiom 45L panniers on it and it fit fine  I put this on my 2009 Surly Travelers Check and it seems to be sturdy I think it would hold a lot more than the listed 45 lbs (Not that you would enjoy steering your bike with anything more than that on it)  This is great for bikes like mine that did not have mid blade fork eyelets.  I would have prefered the steel Surly rack however that was 35 dollars more and the replacement fork for my Travelers Check would have been another 100 dollars.  To be clear I have not actually used this rack yet I just was stoked to find out that the rack is a lot sturdier than a lot of the reviews lead me to believe.
Kindle_Store_5,0,Short and sweet. I enjoyed the story i just wished it had been longer. I would've like to have seen how she turned him down before.

Books_5,1,A good old fashioned ghost story. The characters are well developed and believable. The writing is just as good as the story. I liked the story and the characters. This is a great book. It is well written and very entertaining. I can't imagine what to expect from a book with such a name. I picked up this book because I had read a few books in the series. It was a fun read. I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series. I would highly recommend this book. I liked this book and it was great!  I enjoyed it so much that I bought it for my son. He loves it!I love the characters and the plot and this book was great.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"I bought the 6 month one for my 6 month old and found it to be a little tight around the thighs but still a secure fit.  I got the 12 month one when my daughter hit 17 lbs even though the 6 month size says it goes up to 18 lbs.  It is a little big but gives more room around the legs which she needs. She will be able to wear the 12 month size for awhile. I love how easily these diapers come on and off and they look so much cuter than the disposables.  They are waterproof, too!"
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"Fits my 140 pound German Shepherd,  not an easy thing to do."
Books_5,1,"How do you rate a book on the quality?  I did.  The level of detail is so vivid that the reader can see how the characters have grown, how the plot has developed, and how the characters have been altered.  There are many levels to the story, each with its own name and theme.  I also enjoyed the fact that the book was so well-crafted and detailed that I could not put the book down.  I have a hard time putting down a book.  I highly recommend it.I absolutely loved this book.  I was just so excited to read it and am glad I did."
Electronics_5,1,"Really easy to use, and works well.  It is a little pricey for a small screen, but is well worth the extra money.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,"At first, this was a little bulky, but once you get it on, it's a pretty good size. I had to replace a couple of the plastic plastic switches in the case, but it's a little smaller than the size of the previous one. This is still a good size, and a bit smaller than the one I had in the old one. I think the new one will be just fine, but I'm not sure if it will be able to hold up to the heat of the old one.

I had to read the book to get through the story. The story is so compelling and well told. It is a perfect story about two women with their own"
Electronics_5,0,"I upgraded my Denon 2809CI for the SR5008.  The SR5008 chassis size is not as deep so it doesn't take up as much space on the shelf.  Since this is the bedroom I have a simple two channel setup with Axiom M60 floorstanding speakers and HSU Research STF-2 subwoofer.  I like the attention to detail such as the little vibration absorbing material (looks like Sorbothane soft rubber) on the feet to protect the electronics from the nearby subwoofer.

Previously I could not use Audessy with the older Denon because of the simple speaker setup.  Now with the Marantz SR5008 I was able to fly through the Audessy measurements and the sound difference is NIGHT AND DAY!  With the Audessy calibrated stereo setup, the sound is 3-dimensional and super clear.  I'm also selected the bi-amp option for the front speakers just to try it out (not sure if that makes a difference, but it's cool to have the option to put those extra Watts to use).  I would describe it as having a ""warm"" sound which I love.  I used to be a musician and I can distinguish subtle differences in sound quality.

The on-screen menu is very simple and easy to navigate.  When streaming Pandora Internet Radio, the song name and play timer is displayed on the Marantz portal window so I can still see the song name while the TV is turned off.  Some review on the web mentioned the lack of WiFi, but I think it would be silly to integrate WiFi into a high end AVR receiver because WiFi technology is changing so fast (802.11G, N, AC, etc. will be obsolete well before the receiver is outdated).  Simply get a tiny WiFi adapter such as the Netgear WNCE2001 or WNCE3001, plug it in and you're set for wireless as well."

Books_5,1,"When I first read My Little Pony, I knew that I was going to love this book. It is so heart-warming, so funny and so funny. It was a very moving story that was told in the style of a true story. I learned so much about the world of the Pony Kingdom. And I love the way it is woven into the story. There is a great sense of danger and love and friendship and friendship and friendship. It was all there in this book.

I loved the way the book was told. I loved the characters. I loved the interactions between them. And I loved the story. It was a very sweet story. And it was a very funny story.

The first couple of pages are about the two people, both of whom have a shared interest in religion and politics. They both have been in the same boat for years. This book is a great introduction to the two women. The second book, ""The Metamorphosis,"" is about the two women, both of whom have been married for 40 years. Both of whom have been very interested in religion and politics. They both have been very interested in politics, and they both have been very interested in their marriage. I like that the women have been in love for 40 years. They both have been married for 40 years, and they both have been very interested in their marriage. I think this book should be a little more of a look at the history of marriage. This is a great book."

The handle seems sturdier than others coupled with being a little longer.  The wheels are fine, I didn't want a ""spinner"" briefcase, but I was willing to let that go because of its other assets.  It seems some people have many more problems with wheels on luggage than I, so I must not test their durability enough to proclaim these ""sturdy"". They seem fine.  The quality of the outside material is a heavy nylon type, not something that would rip easily.  The laptop protector incorporated in the case is easily adjustable and accomodates my Dell E6510(17"") easily.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"This thing is the bomb!! Easy to use (with two people), and does the trick thoroughly. My vent was super clogged (and I knew that going in to the cleaning process). We proceeded slowly, doing only the top ten feet first, then proceeding down to the next sections. So, we probably lowered it down a total of 5 times. We used cell phones to communicate with each other. The person on the roof lowers the hose down (with the air flow off), then turns on the air flow and slowly pulls the hose up. Pounds of lint came out with each pass. It helps to loosely cover the lower vent opening with a bag (or pillowcase) when the air is switched on, to save from a big mess inside the laundry room. When the hose finally makes it down to the lower opening, and the air is turned on, a nasty blast of lint will come out of the end (as it should), but nothing like what comes out of the top of the vent. The direction of the blast coming out of the ball on the end of the hose systematically keeps the lint rolling upward and outward. There was nothing left in my dryer vent after the last pass. My clothes dry TWICE as fast as they used to."

The only reason I gave this a 5 stars is because I am a huge fan of Tootlemania and this is definitely one of the best in the series. The size is perfect and the quality is good. I love that it is a game that is very similar to the original Tootlemania. I will say that I will probably not buy this again for any reason because it is so very similar to the original. I would recommend this game to anyone. I love these for our little ones!  We have been playing with them for a few months now and it is still great!

Kindle_Store_5,0,"WOWSER

I have read some truly remarkable horrible stories based on facts over my time but this one is truly dark, full of mental and physical anguish, abuse and RAW emotions its tangible. You can feel it oozing out from its pages. I am taking deep breathes here. Its somewhat written as a memoir, but in other parts reads like a novel. Except for the fact this was reality for the author. There are advisory notes from the author:
If you yourself are disturbed by abuse and any of the violent abusive events in this story, she says, do not read unless you can survive it or it can lead YOU down a dark path:

If you have been abused, the same applies

Its interesting to me that she has not written this for a therapy as most do or a story to be told. The mental state and dark places this author went to in writing this book is deeper than a very deep black hole. She says how the book has not been edited and re edited so as to take the meaning and exact happenings out of this true story. It is how it is. The woman that is broken and quite frankly mentally disturbed [and who wouldn't be by this] is different from the woman today. This is not written as a memoir it is written more like a novel. Do not think you can read this book for enjoyment, definitely not. Its a journey, its a learning curve, its a lesson. Anyone can take something away from this read. There is no way I can say its NOT distressing because it IS. The author admits, she was insane when she wrote this, as an advocate for mental awareness, I would say, she definitely was emotionally distressed, disturbed and needed mental health care to cope. Whichever way she managed to get all those pieces back together, my hat goes off to her as it would have been oh so easy to have departed in other ways."

Books_5,0,"I found the book to be very interesting and agree for the most part with the author.  However, I am not sure ALL murderers have had a bad upbringing where they were whipped or even abused.  I am sure there are cases where this is not so.  It would be interesting to examine more cases especially here in America.  I was raised by a half German and half English mom and was not abused much.  I turned out to be a happy and productive person.  I do not blame my mom for her abuses which were there but nobody is perfect and she grew up with the threat of the strap herself.  I do not see the purpose in blaming parents except in the cases described in the book.  To me I wonder if it is more of a German problem but I am probably nave to think that.  As stated in the book it is not limited to just one country.  I know from the parenting books out now (since I am a parent to two girls myself) in America the opposite is the case.  It is a fear to even raise a hand to a child because of the consequences.  Which is good.  My sister has perfectly mannered children who have never been harmed physically and I hope emotionally as well.  Although I do not know.  My children are not well behaved but they are allowed to be children and I try not to be permissive but it happens.  A very quick read for I read it in less than a week.  Nice read.  It kept me entertained.  A little too much on Hitler though and I did not care to read about the child murderer either."
Movies_and_TV_5,0,"I liked getting an American based movie and that they changed some of the terms such as Muggle to No-mag (spelling?) because that is true to the culture, America may be the offspring of Britain and we may all speak English but we still change things to make it our own lift vs elevator for example.

It definitely had a different feel than the previous HP movies, darker, older, more mature. But it's still neat to see the origins of some of the HP lore"
Books_5,0,"I read this the first time so many years ago, that I do have to admit I had forgotten so much about the many side stories and characters. Why that should take away from a novel for some readers is beyond me, but everyone has their favorites. I would only say, so many stories in books and movies these days are so pat. I always tease my wife for rushing through her novels, and she's always teasing me for insisting on reading every. single. word, and doing so at a pace I think the author may appreciate. If a book's an easy read, I'll motor through it in a couple hours, but a more dense novel filled with beautiful writing, well, I'll happily go at a tortoise's pace. I bring this up to say, this novel stuck with me for so many years for a reason. Why let yourself get frustrated if the author chooses to take his time? I read this as a child and over the years have loved apocalyptic stories. Some of the more recent blockbuster movies in the genre have greatly disappointed. Lucifer's Hammer was brilliant in that it showed how so many outstanding plans, crafted by sharp people, dedicated to detail, can all fall to, well, you'll see. The guy made homemade beef jerky, stocked his jeep with all the necessary gear, and backup gear of the most important stuff, and was absolutely prepared for the coming disaster."

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic part is very hard to put on. The material is thick and the material is not durable. I would suggest you"
Movies_and_TV_5,0,"Even though I gave this movie four stars (for originality and for its contribution to the genre),with a bigger budget(a Leone/Morricone kind of treatment),better dialogue (the dub-job was,quite frankly,abyssmal)and some fine tuning on the plot,this movie could have been the greatest western of all time. The opening scene where this mysterious stranger (Django)is dragging this coffin through the mud and its contrast against the sentimental crooning of the opening music is,possibly,one of the weirdest visuals I've ever seen in a movie,let alone a western. There are a couple of stomach turningly violent scenes that I did not care for and the body count is probably comparable to ""the matrix""....I don't know what all to say...This is one weird,gloomy,gothic,machine gun,spaghetti western. The addition of the trailer and the Franco Nero interview were nice bonuses."

Books_5,0,"The author has lived in Japan for seven years and seemed to have understood its culture and economy sufficiently enough.  I traveled Japan and thought this book helped have a bit more of an insight into the Japanese culture.

First three chapters of the book are on hikikomori, which are also used to describe the book as a whole, but these chapters have absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the book. It is like two separate books in one.

This is an economic and cultural analysis of  the declining Japanese economy supported by statistics and the author's own views. It also draws stark comparison with South Korea. I had no idea there were such fundamental differences in their economies and people."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,It is almost the perfect craft light.  The lights are great and so is the magnification.  The lights circle the viewer so it well distributed light.  It doesn't tend to tip over like some of them do.  The neck is just like it shows not a snake neck so is not the best for some situations.  But given that I would still buy it again.
Electronics_5,1,"Five stars for functionality. It works. The only problem is that it's not really a stereo, but a pair of ear buds. The ear buds don't fit comfortably in the ear, so it's a little difficult to pair them. If you have a pair of ear buds, you may need to put them on your head and them on the head and then adjust the volume/angle. I just turned the volume up to the right and it didn't work.

Overall, I'd definitely recommend this for anyone who wants to use headphones, but for people who are just looking for a pair of ear buds, this might be a good option.I bought this to use on my iPad mini 2 and it works perfectly. It does not interfere with the screen at all. I have a hard time finding a way to turn it off, but I have a hard time finding a way to turn it off. I have the ear buds on the bottom right side of the screen and they are on the top right of the screen. I have a hard time finding a way to turn it off. The only way to turn it off is to turn it off while sitting on the couch or on the bed. The only way to turn it off is to put it on the floor and turn it off while sitting on the couch or on the bed.

Books_5,0,"Elizabeth Hand is able to do what so many writers strive for -- to emulate Joseph Conrad when he says, ""My task which I am trying to achieve is, by the power of the written word, to make you hear, to make you feel  it is, before all, to make you see. That  and no more, and it is everything."" This is the most deeply *visual* prose I've read since...well, since Conrad.

With this in mind, one line from the book struck me: ""How many of us can say we've made a new world out of the things that terrify and move us?"" Well,Elizabeth Hand can, anyway. There's not a lazy sentence in this entire book, which is one of the few out there that any writer can read and learn from, and any reader will find a powerful and moving experience.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"I bought this single unit soap dispenser to use next to the bathroom sink when I changed out my sink/countertop and was unable to get a second (but not a third) hole drilled in the top of my non-custom countertop.  (My previous countertop had a soap dispenser in the granite top which was wonderful so I'm coming from a place of being used to pumping soap rather than handling a bar.)  This dispenser was easy to install and easy to fill.  No drilling is required as it comes with mounting tape and silicone.  The pump itself was easy to prime (which is necessary when you add a thicker soap for sure).  I purchased the dispenser with the satin nickel-like finish; however, the finish is a bit ""cooler"" than traditional metal satin nickel finishes.  Note the pix where I show the ""warm"" satin nickel finish of my faucet vs. the ""cool"" satin nickel finish of the dispenser.  And, I took a star off because the description indicated I was buying a dispenser with a satin nickel-like finish; however, the pump button itself has a shiny chrome-like finish.  I don't know why they couldn't have made the pump button satin nickel finish as well!  All in all it works great so functionally it's 5* but cosmetically it gets 4* and the seller gets 1* for not listing the chrome button on its web site."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"I was looking for some sturdy, good quality stainless pots and pans, but I couldn't afford the all-clads. I did a lot of research, and I came across this set. I even saw some of the pots on America's Test Kitchen saying that they were their top cheap choice for pots.

I knew that some people complained about discoloration when cooking, well, I found out that most stainless will discolor with normal use. I have indeed had my pots discolor if I do not clean them properly (chore-boy) or if I have cooked something for a really long time in them. In my experience, I learned that if there is anything stuck to the pans, boil water in them and it will take off just about anything. Also, if they do discolor, that will usually go away after I use them again.

As far as the whole eggs stick thing, yes they will. You have to lower your stove temp considerably to cook delicate things as the aluminum core really heats up well. Also, learn how to cook in stainless. That means look it up on the net etc until you are used to them. It takes some time and some burnt food in the meantime until you get the hang of it, especially coming from non-stick. Also, butter isn't the best for keeping food from sticking. Smart balance or pam works the best.

Really, I have been able to cook some great things that I couldn't cook easily with my old set. First of all, these can go into the oven and the dishwasher, two benefits over my old set. Also, I get a much better browning on meats and other foods with this set.

Overall, I really like this set a lot. I would eventually like all-clad, but for less than the cost of a single pan, I got the whole set of Cuisinart. I think it worked out well."

second, this battery grip is made by Canon, so it feels and matches the body identical. if you are wondering how is feels about the quality, then you should go ahead and grab the grip on your DSLR. the feeling that you get from it is the feeling that you expect from the battery grip. (mine is Canon 50D)

* This product comes with a 6 AA battery tray so no need to spend your money to get it. the battery grip is made in Japan.

Installation is easy, takes less then a minute. plus it has an instruction in it. after installed it my 50D looks a lot more professional but camera with the grip plus a Canon flash, it feels a lot heavier. but i can deal with it, and it is not that a big deal.

over all good product and i would recommend it"

I currently have a wooden Lime & Lemon squeezer. That one is great for certain things that needs a bit of pulp of the Lime & Lemon. What I don't have is one of these Heavy Duty Lime & Lemon squeezer. This one has some weight to it and feels very strong in your hands. I like that there is 2 different bowl design. One for the Lime, since limes are smaller than the Lemon. And the other bowl for the Lemon. For some people, that is just extra work and troublesome when using it. I find it very useful and smart that they also made to color coded to match.

Now to use this properly, you MUST place the Lime or Lemon with the expose side, facing DOWN. This is how the squeezer works by pushing the Lime or Lemon down, causing it to flip inside out, so the juice can come out to the bottom of the squeezer. I know it looks like you should place the Lime or Lemon with the expose side facing up to match the squeezers shape but that will not work and Lime or Lemon juice will splash everywhere and there won't be that many juice coming out of it.

Books_5,0,"I hate to give one star to any book but this was really awful. Perhaps the story would have been better if I didn't have to stumble through considerable editing difficulties. Whoever was in charge of this department at Warner books should have been fired. My copy is the first edition and there were numerous punctuation problems. So much so that it detracted from the story. I have never, I repeat never, read a book with this many mistakes. Willa Hammer headed west after losing her adopted family. Settling in the Bighorn Mountains she comes upon various melodramatic characters that think only of themselves. One of the characters just grated on my nerves. You'll know who it is without naming names. Smith Bowman, the hero, is a loner in many ways. When he meets Willa he is leery of her at first. In denial, he doesn't want to admit to himself that he is attracted to her. It scares him. Of course, we know how the story ends. If you find another edition without all the mistakes AND if hokey language doesn't bother you, you may like this romance.

Rules are broken and consenquences are to be had. This is a side of the Boogeyman that you won't see coming. This is a paranormal but with a twist.

Kindle_Store_5,0,"I enjoy this series for the facts that it is science fiction and erotic and a little kick ass. I love the characters for not being boring but having some larger than life personalities with just the right amount of neurosis to make them very human and likeable. The worlds that they inhabit are just as varied as the people that live on them. This is the story of Steffania Rickard and Ramsey DeKieran's, the Captain of the Blue Daggers and a disgraced Lord who was found guilty of murder.

Captain Rickard is sent to bring Ramsey to meet with Ari and Doral to discuss a mission they wish him to under take that could mean a full pardon for him, if he returns. Ramsey has been a part of her fantasies since they fought side by side in the Haarb wars, but she would never give into them. Ramsey finds the Captain attractive but knows a woman like her could never give in to the types of hungers he has. Both are very wrong.

The pair are sent to bring back a Verdantian who is very important to the survival of the planet, Lady Alessa DeAlbero has been sold to Veacon Narr, a man who takes pleasure in bringing women to their knees. Everyone else who has attempted a rescue has not returned and he is considered to be expendable even if Steffania isn't. But together they find a way to do the impossible.

Though the story revolves around their rescue effort it is really about two people who have had the worst happen to them but are finding someone to complete them. Highly recommend."

We had made Christmas cookies just before Christmas and she loved rolling the dough and using cookie cutters.  With this set you can act like you are rolling the dough and use a suction cup device to remove your cookie shapes from the dough. That in itself makes this a good purchase. Can't comment much on the other pieces but will say that the bread is pretty flimsy. Would still purchase again.

Kindle_Store_5,0,"It's always fun to find a new author to enjoy!  This second in the BBB series was just as good as the first book.  Both leads were very likeable, the secondary characters were fabulous, and the storyline flowed smoothly with easily solved conflicts.

I'm subtracting a half star, though, because I came across 30+ grammar-type errors.  None of them were significant to the story or the meaning of a sentence, just small things like using the wrong tense, the wrong spelling for sound-alike words, or leaving out or adding in extra words incorrectly.  These errors should have been proof-read out before publishing ... and I'm disappointed they weren't.

I still recommend this story if you enjoy a good storyline with some delicious intimate scenes, a H who's a little, I mean a lot, rough around the edges and a sweet and mature h.  Both are beautiful, inside and out, if a little broken by their life experiences.  Which is a great segue to the beautiful cover ... WOUZA! ... that is a scrumptious match to Evie's description of Daryk.  Love when the cover art actually depicts a physical likeness to the character in the book, even down to the tats.

Books_5,0,"The essence of a good novel is its ability to whisk you away to a place where you would not normally go. Linda Collison does such a thing wonderfully in her debut novel, Star-Crossed. Patricia Kelley sets out in 1760 from her paupered but privileged place in English society to claim her dead father's only estate asset, a sugar plantation in Barbados. Stowing away on a boat, she is first moonstruck by a bosun's mate, Brian Dalton, but then faces the dilemma of choosing Dalton's love or marriage's security with a more sensible choice to marry the ship's doctor, MacPherson. The entire story swings many times like a pendulum between this two contrary choices.

Along the cruise, readers are exposed to life on several English navy ships are Patricia travels with Dalton and/or MacPherson to various Caribbean locales in changing circumstances. As she literally rides the staterooms by day and the yardarms by night, her life takes equally polar changes that can be sensually experienced by those wishing to join her on the page. Her final destination satisfies both her heart and her head.

A thoroughly enjoyable story."
Books_5,0,"I could not take this book seriously after I read Chapter 1, The Myth of Calorie Math. The author quotes the study, Energy Density, Portion Size, and Eating Occasions: Contributions to Increased Energy Intake in the United States, 19772006 by Kiyah Duffey and Barry Popkin at the Univ. of NC at Chapel Hill, by saying that the study discovered the number of calories consumed per person per day increased by a jaw-dropping 570 calories between 1977 and 2006. The author of this book then goes on to state that if the average person is consuming 570 more calories than necessary per day and if the calorie-counting math we hear about daily is accurate, then the average person should have gained 476 pounds since 2006.

This is a misleading example and conclusion.  An increase of 570 calories (which I highly doubt in the first place), does not mean that the average person would gain 476 pounds! At some point, the weight gain would level out until the person reached a higher weight. In fact, the Chapel Hill study concluded that the average consumption was close to 2,374 calories/day in 2006 versus 1,803 in 1977. A human being will not weigh over 600 lbs. by eating 2,374 calories/day.

However, I do agree that these calorie studies are inaccurate, but not because calories don't matter, but because they're based on surveys, not science. The U of NC at Chapel Hill study based their information on an earlier study called, The Nationwide Food Consumption Survey (NFCS), 1977-78, which was a telephone survey in which the person with major responsibility for planning or preparing meals reported on foods purchased the last 7 days, food consumption, a list of the people (age/sex) living in the household, and guests (who may have eaten food). Let me ask you, can you tell me how much food was consumed in your household this week? I cant."
Kindle_Store_5,1,Fast read..Enjoyed reading..Characters were believable and interesting.  Overall a good read.I really enjoyed this book.
Movies_and_TV_5,1,"Big Brother in Britain. A futuristic, futuristic, and futuristic version of the original, ""The Clipper"". The movie had a lot of gore and some blood and gore."

Electronics_5,0,"For the price, this is it man. The cards do sometimes fall out when i open it, so keep it facing up when you open it. I thought 8 cards would be enough, but I quickly found that i needed a bigger case...so if you have a small gig where water may come into play, get it."

Electronics_5,0,"It does what it supposed to do, but it is not any better or clearer than the protective layer that already comes on the Google Nexus 10."
Pet_Supplies_5,1,I've downgraded this review since it has been a long time since I've purchased a new harness.  I've had the harness for a few months and have not noticed any noticeable difference.  I have had it for a few months now and it's still very comfortable for my dog.  I have a 15 pound Maltese and it's been great for her to wear it.  I wish I would have gotten it a few months ago.  I have a 60 pound lab mix and it's been great for her to wear it.  I'm not sure how she is adjusting to this
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,These straps are factory replacement straps for Moultrie game cameras.  Animals like the chew on the straps so they need replacement from time to time. These straps have stayed tight and worked well for me.  It took awhile to receive them after I placed my order.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,"Great for my dog, she loves it and she loves it too.  I have a large one and she loves it.  I am using it in the back yard to take care of our dogs.  It is a good value.I use this as a battery replacement.  The battery is a bit smaller than I expected and it"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,"This rack is gorgeous when it's in the dryer.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because the dishwasher is a bit loud, but otherwise, it's a nice quality piece.  It's a little thin, but it's not too big.

I love it.  I love the color,"
Toys_and_Games_5,0,"This was the 4th leapster game I gave my 5 yr old; she loved it at first. Played it ALL the time.  I was even addicted to it. Unfortunatly, like most games, once you play a long time and master the skills asked...there is little left to do.  The biggest drawback on this one is there is a store you can go to, to buy items for your dog after you earn coins throughout the game...well, my daughter went and bought out all the items as soon as she had the money to do so...then kept going back to the store and realized, they don't restock. So then she stocked up on like 50 bottles of shampoo, water, and dog food :)  Cute, but then she got really frustrated that the screen was really useless at that point and really never needs to go there again.

These dogs do everything, including ""Potty Time""!  Its a really cute game, just wish there were more upgrades, or updates you could download for it to keep the interest in it going.  It drives our cats crazy when my daughter plays it near them b/c the dogs bark all the time, they sound so real!

I would recommend this game; with the knowledge, they will bore of it....eventually...however, I have yet to find a game my daughter doesn't bore of after a few weeks of play."

Movies_and_TV_5,1,"Was there ever a man who could have done more in this movie than this guy?

While I agree with the reviewer that the script and directing were better than the movie itself, I still think it's not a good film. The movie is not very good, and the acting is not very good. I did not like the fact that the only female character I liked was Rachel Weisz. I liked the fact that she was the one that could have been better than the man in the movie. I thought she was really too much for the part of the man in the movie, and the fact that she was the one that could have been better than the man was just too much. The movie has some of the best acting in a movie, and it's a good one to watch. If you're looking for a good film to watch, check out the movie ""MIND"" by Jamie Lee Curtis. It's a very good movie. If you're looking for a good movie to watch, check out the movie ""ROBERT LEE"" by James McAvoy."

I highly recommend it to any collector.my son loves this toy.  it is very durable and easy to use.  he loved playing with it.

I have a 10 year old who loves horses and this one was perfect.  I was able to get it to fit his 7 year old nephew perfectly.  He is 4 and has had many adventures with it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"These are nice little Infusers. The holes are a little small but if you don't overfill the container, the tea is able to steep better. One thing that is confusing is why the photo shows 4 when there are only two per order. Still, the craftsmanship is nice and they are user friendly without making a big mess. I have one at home and one in the office and love the ability to have a cup of my favorite loose tea now without a hassle."
Movies_and_TV_5,0,A good show covering a period before TOS. As a fan of TOS I had a hard time watching the spin off shows.  I found myself liking the Enterprise series despite my skepticism. The series does a good job building the retroactive foundation for the other series if one is willing to overlook a few contradictions.
Movies_and_TV_5,1,this movie stinks i strongly recommend itGreat movie!Very good movie. Great acting!  Great story. Great acting. Great movie. Great movie. Great movie. Great movie. Great movie.
Pet_Supplies_5,0,The carabiner is kind of a pain to use.  I like it because it fits well in a pocket when I am not using it.  To be honest it is not much better than a cheap leash that costs 5 bucks.
Pet_Supplies_5,1,Should have listened to the reviewers. The quality is good but it's not really the best one. I bought this for a friend who has a small dog and she had a very large ear. It was her only ear. I am very pleased with it and will purchase it again.
Electronics_5,0,I bought my V1253 a few years ago and have loved it from the first day! I use an SD card and when the cards gets filled up (350 pix for a 1-gb card)I save it and put in another one!  Nice screen.  Battery stays up for a long time without being recharged!  I carry it in my pocket and just love it.  I'm very satisfied with it.
Kindle_Store_5,0,"Erin Lancaster is an English teacher who has been roped into helping with the cheerleaders and the fund raising auction. She is less than thrilled to find out she has to go up on the auction block herself, and to make matters worse, the emcee for the event in none other than her music crush from her teen years, former front man of Spawn and current front man for Undue Influence, Riley Schultz!
Riley isn't looking forward to emceeing the fundraiser, he only agreed to appease his mother who is on the school board.  When he notices and is instantly taken with the gorgeous blonde and realizes she is going to be auctioned off, he sets a plan in motion and is the highest bidder.  Hes in town for a week, so why not make the best of it!
And, oh my, what these two go through in this one week is full of ups and downs, love and confusion, misunderstandings and conflicts.  I really felt for Riley.  His struggles with his addiction, wanting to just be accepted by his parents, his mothers meddling and the ultimatum! I loved the way Erin backed him up and stood up for him at the barbeque.  Oh and the serenade...**swoon** How can you not love him!!
Great addition to the Tangled Web series!  Ive said it before and Ill said it again, I just love Jade and no-one writes rock romance better."

Movies_and_TV_5,0,"Why do I love this show?

I want every character on this show to be my best friend (except Robin).  They're funny, caring, and awesome.  The actors truly have tons of chemistry, providing a quality show in a half-hour block.

This is no generic sitcom.  Sure, it's got a laugh track and some of the banter is clich&eacute;, however, most of it is incredibly witty and heartfelt.  Ted is engaged in a genuine search for love, and I'm completely wrapped up in it.  I fell in love with the Cake Girl (Victoria, played by Ashley Williams) and was sad to see her go (it's probably why I'm not a huge fan of Robin).  This show has continuity and a compelling storyline; it simply amazes me.

It's very quotable.  I find myself quoting with friends I've talked into watching it (who get equally hooked).  The cast is brilliant, as well as the director and writers.  Bloc Party's song: `This Modern Love' at the close of Season One clenched it for me though, dramatically building up a powerful finale I won't soon forget.  It joins the hall of fame for greatest season finale songs with the likes of The O.C's: Imogen Heap `Hide and Seek' and Grey's Anatomy's: Snow Patrol `Chasing Cars'.

Hands down, this is the best sitcom I've ever seen.  Buy it, watch it, love it.

DISCLAIMER: Though the writers are good at what they do, don't listen to any of their commentaries.  They are exceptionally boring, lackluster, and have slightly soured my enjoyment of the show.  It's that bad."
Electronics_5,0,"I love this bluetooth speaker.  The sound is great and it is small enough to travel with.  This thing is well built and tough and it can easily be used in any outdoor events such as hiking, biking , camping, etc in any weather conditions.  I was able to pair it to my ipod and iphone in a matter of seconds.  I cant wait to use it on my next outdoor adventure."

 5 STAR REVIEW 

Pennie loved to read and that is why she was involved in her monthly book club. She was always comparing those book boyfriends she was reading about. Her social life was missing between her school work and her tight budget there was not much for her to do. But her life would change forever once she finds face to face with Carter, a woman that stop at anything to obtain what she wants. Carter was a business woman and she knew she had to be ruthless in her cut-throat world. When she finds herself with Pennie she knew she wanted to have her, protect her and love her in her own way. However there is a whole lot of issues they will have to face in order for her to be happy with Pennie. Carter and Pennie don't have the conventional relationship, but they know they are good for each other but how far will they are willing to go to achieve their happily ever after?

Well let me tell something this is my first F/F romance and I was surprised how this book had so much to offer. The plot had you sucked in and you will want to read the whole book before you put it down. This book will show you the lengths someone is willing to go for the person they love and no matter how you get there the only thing matters is how you will take it from that point on. I love this book and I will recommend for everyone to read this book. Gifted by author in exchange for an honest review. https://www. facebook."

Toys_and_Games_5,0,"This case is the perfect companion for your Minecraft minis!!  The compartments are actually big enough that you can get two into most of them to double its effective storage.  Some of the Minecraft minis are bigger and don't fit with two in one compartment, but for the most part they work great.  It folds together into a block (nice touch) and has a very good latching mechanism that blends well with the case design.  You could also store a few into the play area of the case when you close it up.  While not very large, when the case opens up there is a play area on the back with several blocks painted to resemble various ores.  A nice little touch.  The plastic seems to be very durable and is a nice looking product overall.  Yes, it is a bit pricey compared to the Dollar Tree storage boxes that my son's figures were in, but he is so happy to have them in their own official home.  A good gift package would be one of these cases and a 3 pack of Minecraft minis!"

Kindle_Store_5,0,"This is a relatively brief but quite helpful book on how to write a nonfiction book specifically tailored to Amazon's Kindle. It's an encouraging book with lots of concrete information and specific resources.

The author's style is breezy and clear. The book is best paired with other Kindle titles authored by Corson-Knowles, including The Kindle Publishing Bible and The Kindle Formatting Bible. All are reasonably priced and provide expert help."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,This is just like what my mom used when I was growing up. Every time I use it I feel like she is in the kitchen with me.
Pet_Supplies_5,0,Design is ok but this feels flimsy.  Straps and zippers not all that great.  Webbing is thin.  Item is NOT padded as pictures appear and it feels like cardboard is sewn in it - I guess to stiffen it?  I am not yet sure what happens if it gets wet but we will be seeing soon enough.  I am not confident this will hold up to use but we will see.  Really hope it will be good!
Kindle_Store_5,1,Cute story but very short. The characters were just too short. The writing was just too weak.

These do not squeak, but it's okay because my pup loves to dig the squeakers out of the squeaky ones. Overall, great product and will probably order again when we lose this batch to the mud or the dog park!"

I had to read a few chapters to get through the first two, and that was a huge relief.  The next two were absolutely amazing.  I still find myself thinking about the book.  I love the book, I can't wait to read the next one.

So, I guess I'll just go on.  I don't know if I'm going to read the next one.  I have a feeling I'm going to read the next one.  I don't know.  I just hope it's worth reading.

I am a HUGE fan of Ms. King, and I hope she continues to write better books.  I will be reading the next book in the series.

Kindle_Store_5,0,"I struggled with how to rate this one. The first half of this book is one of the most fascinating stories I have ever read. Like Kaiden, I was completely immersed in Serena and Elodie's world. The writing style is so compelling, and the pace of the story is perfect. The progression of the sexual tension is also incredibly exciting, even when it's one sided. That is an astounding accomplishment on its own. The author created amazing chemistry between Kaiden and Serena right from the beginning. I realize now that part of that was due to what a unique character Serena was and how fascinated he was by her.

Unfortunately, Serena later loses her uniqueness and becomes a regular girl in love. Considering the physical prowess she displayed in the first part of the story, I was expecting her to become an amazing athlete or to do something extraordinary. I still highly recommend this book for the thrilling first half of the story, but the end didn't fulfill the potential of these characters."
Kindle_Store_5,1,I fell in love with this book and the characters. I loved how they were both strong and determined. I felt the pain they endured. I loved the fact that the main character was truly
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"Good Quality bag, should hold up well. Like the looks of it. Tapered front fits under seat well. Strap on rear for tail light is nice.
I don't care for some bags out there that have all kinds of outside straps, bottle holders, pockets, etc. This one is more streamlined with your stuff stored inside the bag, not held somehow on the outside. And the inside is roomy!

Held back on a 5 star rating for several reasons.

One, it's a little pricey. Forty bucks is a lot for a bag to store stuff on the back of your bike.

And secondly the design of how the top opens up could be better.
The top is held closed by two zippers down each side, plus a velcro closure across the front.
The velcro flap is located under your seat, where it is hard to get to. And it's strong velcro, so you really need to get a firm grip on it.
And then the zippers are held together with a strap, the idea being that you can pull on the strap and open both zippers at the same time.
In theory this sounds good but reaching the strap, which is also under the seat, is not the easiest thing to do either.

I ended up cutting off the strap holding the 2 zippers together. This helps quite a bit. Now I can quickly open the bag just on one side without having to undo the velcro. And you can pretty much grab what you want with just one zipper open.

IF the zippers opened from the rear, and the velcro closure was across the rear, then it would be an ideal bag and maybe I wouldn't feel like forty bucks was too much for it."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"For my work jeans it's a perfect belt. It holds up while leather/plastic belts twist, stretch out, stain with sweat. This holds up and looks good month after month of hard use."
Books_5,0,"Jules Feiffer is characteristically hilarious in all of his books (like the Man in the Ceiling, for instance), however, this book is more than just hilarity. It is deceptively simple; simple in style, and simple in writing, but Feiffer teaches countless lessons in this book. However, instead of being preachy, he disguises them behind his singular style of ""funniness"". I could cite a hundred of these lessons. For instance, the ""Valley of Vengeance""; the villagers who thought of nothing but ""getting even"" with their neighbours, burning down their house and snatching their stuff. They lived in a veritable paradise but they never looked beyond harming their fellow man, and when Roger showed up as an eagle and introduced laughter and beauty, their lives changed, and they thought less about vengeance and more about harmony.
Also, it has its funny points (which are many), but it is also despairingly tragic at times. I read this book first when I was 8, and it was just a funny book, but having read it again at an older age (16), I understand even more than I saw before. So, if you get a chance, this book is a must.

Hey Sorry, this is my real Review. I accidentally wrote the same review but on my Mum's (Deb) account below.

I was just so excited to read it and am glad I did.  I love the way the author takes a character from a historical book and turns them into a modern day hero.  I was so caught up in the plot that I had to put the book down for a while.  I will definitely be reading more of her work.  I really enjoyed this book and look forward to the next in
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Tiny, thin, handy as can be, simple as ... uhh ... simple, and cheap enough that I bought 5 of these and gave them out to co-workers. We all would occasionally find ourselves with the need for a knife or wrench or screwdriver, but the campus where we work is a ""no weapons allowed"" kind of place, so even a Swiss Army type knife might ruffle some feathers. Taking this little thing out doesn't raise anyone's eyebrows at all, and while it's not as effective as a Leatherman or something along those lines, it's still darned handy to have for popping open boxes, prying open stuff, and so on. Shipping took quite a long time - about a month - but considering that it's coming straight from China and you're only paying ONE DOLLAR apiece for these things, it's kinda hard to really gripe much.

Only complaint: The little page of instructions that tells what is what on this tool are entirely in Chinese. No English instructions whatsoever, so you've gotta guess what does what on this thing. I Googled it and there are some pics with numbers over each spot that list the function of each thing on this. Primarily, the handiest parts are the chisel-ground ""knife"" edge, the flat screwdriver corner, the ""saw"" section, and the bottle opener, in that order. I've used a couple of the other features once or twice, but they're kind of ""meh"" details that don't mean much (to me, anyway)."

I can't imagine the level of emotion and attention to detail that would have been put into it. But if you are a fan of the original series, you will enjoy this movie. You will be glad you did.I'm not a big fan of the series but it's a good one. A couple of the characters are great and the whole story is fairly simple. The story was a bit complicated"

Books_5,0,"Growing up, there are certain stories that you are told are classics.  Your parents have read them, your teachers suggest them and all the critics continually laud them.  `The Swiss Family Robinson' is one of those books.  Just the very title causes one to take notice, and if you have ever read the book or happened to see the Disney film, you are taken to a lovely place of nostalgia whenever someone mentions it.

The great thing about books like this one is that these stories and the way they are shaped, molded and ultimately told are timeless.  Any age, sex or domination can and will enjoy this.  There are so many themes broached, but in a beautiful package that never feels overwhelming or too stuffed.  Everything feels relaxed and natural.  It is also a testament to real storytelling that the novel remains exciting and intriguing no matter how familiar you are with the story.  Settling in this past month to read this to my kids was a great way to relive the beauty and grace of this novel, watching it captivate them as well as me (new ears and old).

The language is fluid (which is not always so in these older classics) and the action is always present, even during seeming mundane situations.  My children were always intrigued, and I loved plowing through the chapters with them.  The lush imagery presented by Wyss is unforgettable and really a notch above most of what we have to read today.  There is truth in the idea that one cannot beat a classic, and `The Swiss Family Robinson' is a classic for a reason."

He loves Bev, she has been his best friend since forever and he can't wait to go on tour with her all girl band, The Disenchantments, before he and Bev tour Europe. They have decided not to go to college like everyone else. The other band members are Alexa(younger sister to Meg and still in high school) and Meg (will be dropped off to college at the end of the band's tour )while Colby is the driver of his uncle's prized Melinda, set-up guy and go to guy for everyone. He is an awesome artist, so is Bev, which makes it even more difficult when Bev acts very strange at the start of the tour and tells Colby she applied to RISD and will attend in the fall!!! Colby is stunned because Bev gives him no explanation, but Meg and Alexa make him feel great. They go to some interesting stops on their tour, get involved in trying to solve a tattoo mystery, and meet some ""different"" people, places, etc. There were so many great quotes, Colby SEES things and his comments are insightful, thoughtful, yet you know he is clamoring to find some meaning in this tour and what should he do now that they are not going to Europe. The more I found out about Colby's friends and what made them unique, LaCour's writing, setting, characters were all so memorable. I am not into tattoes, still am not after reading this book, but I do like the murals and graffiti artistry."

The Haier TV is a vast improvement over the Coby model: it has a nice attractive look and actually takes up less room than the Coby did, although their screen sizes are identical.  The picture quality is very impressive for such a little TV, although as other reviewers have mentioned, the audio quality is HORRIBLE.  If you intend to watch this TV often, I would suggest investing in a nice inexpensive pair of computer speakers....but this may not be necessary for casual viewing of news or weather channels.  I would have liked a USB port or memory card slot for viewing pics, etc., but all in all I am very happy with my purchase.  Nice that it has a full-function remote too!"

Books_5,0,"Unfortunately, I just finished ""Wild Fire"" and am sad to report that DeMille's quality is continuing the slide downward that began with ""Night Fall"".

Through his magnus opus ""Up Country"", Nelson DeMille was my favorite fiction author. But in his last two books, he's decided to weave his stories in and out of catastrophic real-life events. I frankly don't care about John Corey's posiiton on George W. Bush or when to invade Iraq...I appreciate an author who creates an entirely new universe and populates it USING HIS IMAGINATION. Just like DeMille used to do in his other novels. Shoehorning real life events into his recent books has taken priority over a strong narrative and the storytelling suffers under this neglect. It's a blatant attempt at broadening his appeal that does so at the detriment of his longtime fans' intellect.

It's also worth noting he's writing books now that run about half the number of pages his past work offered. It's been pointed out he has contractual deadlines to deliver a book every November...I personally don't feel like this is a valid justification for the startling decrease in pages and by extension, story.

Overall, it's sad to realize that the author whose work I fell in love with is no longer committed to the same level of quality he used to consistantly provide."
Toys_and_Games_5,1,"First, I wound up buying this set, as it is a great starter set for the kids. It is so small that it is difficult to attach the ring to the cover of the other set.

Electronics_5,0,"I have had 3 pairs of this headset. I lost one, bought one for my wife, and bought myself a replacement. As a mono bluetooth it works great, although a bit on the heavy side. As a stereo bluetooth I love it. I love not having a wire connecting to my phone when I am working out. I don't know how many times I unplugged or ripped my phone out of my pocket when the wired headset cable got snagged on something. This is just so much more convenient. Some complain that the sound it not as good, but I find it more than adequate for working out. When you buy a stereo bluetooth you are not looking for concert sound as much as you are looking for the safety and convenience of not having connecting wires hanging out of your ears. My only complaint is the ear look is of very poor design. I have had to call Jabra several times to order replacements because the bendable wire section breaks from the hard plastic part that goes into the ear piece. It got to the point that Jabra would just send me 3 complimentary ear loops at no charge."

I love the style of these slip on shoes. I bought the brown/ bronze color. The shoe was slightly short. Not uncomfortably so, but I like room for a sock liner. Not with this shoe. The worst thing about the shoe is that dip in the heel. Somehow that dip makes the sides of the shoe gape open. Noticeably too. I don't know how the shoe would do with a wide foot. My feet are medium width. There was no side support with these shoes.  They looked like I was wearing a shapeless bedroom slipper. I'm returning them.

I've had no problems with this knife. I have used it for almost a month now. I've used it a lot, and it's not really the sharpest edge. It's just a little sharper than the one I had before. The other one I have is a little less sharp, but I would say it's still great for cutting very sharp fruit. I would also say that it's very comfortable for me. I've tried several other knives and this one is the sharpest one I've ever used. I've tried many different knives and this one is the sharpest one I've ever used.I received this item as a gift.  The quality is excellent.  The color is vibrant and the quality is beautiful.  It's a great addition to my kitchen.  I would highly recommend this product.I bought this item for my daughter who"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,"So glad I bought this.  I love the look and feel of it, and the size and the appearance are great.  I am very happy with the purchase.This is a great fan. It is quiet and does not have a fan noise. This fan is very quiet and does not have a fan noise. I will keep buying from Amazon.com again.I've had this for about a year now and I love it!  The color is great and the very soft feel makes it very comfortable to sleep on.  The only issue I have is that the coffee is still a little too hot and the cup is still cold when it's done."
Pet_Supplies_5,1,Didn't really notice any difference in my dog's coat. I will keep this for the next
Movies_and_TV_5,0,"I was so glad all the characters were very appealing and kept  my interest. I think the more I watch movies with different life styles I will be more excepting to it. I know these are just movies, but you can get the questions answered without putting people on the spot. I wanted to know how do gay people have sex? And how do they go about meeting one another in public? Thank you for providing answers and a different perspective!"
Books_5,0,Great story about the Polish underground and the little told story of their effort to rescue victims of the Natzi reign of terror and death.  The role of the depleted Warsaw zoo is fascinating.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"Great fit, super comfortable, warm, but doesn't make you sweat. It's a perfect workout shirt or great for wearing under a jersey."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"ok.. for those who think this is too weak.
The battery that comes with this, don't use it.
Get a fully charge battery and it will run much better.

it gets weaker when battery almost dead. and sadly the battery that comes with it is not good."
Movies_and_TV_5,1,"I really enjoyed it. Not a bad movie, just not a lot of action."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"I like to have air circulating in the room while I sleep but don't like it blowing directly on me like my ceiling fan does.  with this I can aim it in any direction and still get the airflow with our it directly blowing on me.  I have had this fan for 2 months now and use it every night, it seems to be well built and is a nice design."
Kindle_Store_5,1,These books take you on a journey of self discovery and growth. This is a must read. I read this book in the last few days and have enjoyed it. The characters are well written and well developed. I would highly recommend this book. This was an excellent read.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"These are by far the best hog rings ive used. I run a market that bags our ice on site and we use a hog ring pliers to do so. Most are very inefficient at making tight rings, these guys have an edge on each side that let them slide past each other and thus making a very tight seal. Ive used these on chicken fence and upholstery as well. These won't disappoint."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,I put paper in one corner of the cabinet and put a piece of paper in the other corner.
Toys_and_Games_5,0,Smaller than expected but are very well made! Smell like they were made and shipped right off. Bought these for my 2 year old daughter. Like the cute story behind the boxes that comes with it.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,"Have no complaints or issues, this is the best measuring cup I have ever had. I have one in my bathroom and the other in my office. The cup is easy to clean and it does not slip."
Toys_and_Games_5,1,"First off, this kit's only intended for the 1st year class.  There is a tiny one-piece set that the kid can put together and then put back together.  In other words, it is a simple set of stairs, a one-piece set that is easy to assemble, and a 2-piece set that is very difficult.  So it is a little challenging for older kids to put together, but it is pretty easy for younger kids to put together.  The kit comes with a few parts that the kids can use, but they don't actually put them together.  So it's a little more challenging for older kids to put together.  It is also a little harder for younger kids to put together.  It is also a little more challenging for younger kids to put together.  The pieces are very small, so it is a little harder for them to put together.  Overall, this is a very educational set that is a good value for a 5-year-old.

As for the price, it's $20 for the set, which is a little more than I paid for the set I was given.  I was surprised by the price point of this set, but I'm glad I paid $20 for it.  I bought it as a gift,"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,1,I bought this as a gift for my husband and he loved it. He loves the way the front is so adjustable. The front is a bit snug around the waist so it is not too tight.
Electronics_5,1,"Thing is great, haven't used it yet, but it is good enough."
Kindle_Store_5,0,"This series keeps getting better and better. I would say this one can be read as a stand alone, since no story lines overlap and there are no characters from the first story included in this one. At the beginning I disliked Kirk as much as TJ, but Rain Carrignton has a way redeeming the characters and make you fall in love with them. He saved Malcolm and gave him a better life, despite the unconventional beginning to their relationship. My heart was breaking for Malcolm and the hand that he was dealt in life, but he surprised me by showing his strength and actually becoming the hero in various ocassions. The love of the biker brothers was beautiful to witness when they all came together for one of their own. Can't wait for Sammy's story, because he needs his HEA."
Kindle_Store_5,0,"Well I am wondering if I can begin a class action suit against Mr. Anderle - I bought Book 1 less than a week ago and I just purchased book 9 this morning - where has my life outside of these books gone !!!!!!

Still loving the books - the plot is interesting enough that he moves from one to the other seamlessly. We had the development phase, we had the revenge phase, we had are now into the cleanup phase - get rid of those nasty loose ends before we rush to the stars.

Thought I should catch-up with the reviews before I head home, pour a glass of wine and settle into the next installment. He keeps me coming back for more."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,Perfect for my Cat Food on Top and my Dog Food on the Bottom and store the bags in the pantry. Best price ever on Amazon compared to the popular Pet Stores. LOVE it!  It rolls around and is so handy when feeding hungry cats and dogs.

Movies_and_TV_5,0,I like the series. I liked being pulled into a show and forget about the world.  Watch fantasy a bit and its pretty cool.  Story was fun.
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"what can you say, good food, well balanced and the dogs loved it arrived well packed undamaged and in a very timely amount of time"
Books_5,0,"This book presents an overwhelming topic in a very non-overwhelming way.  Ten year-old Akilah finds her best friend changed when she comes back from a summer trip to Nigeria to visit her grandmother and go through a ""coming of age ceremony.""  Eventually her friend confesses that her parents took her to an illegal doctor to be circumcised.  Akilah promises not to tell anyone, but these things have a way of getting told.

Akilah tells the story from the eyes of a child, but this book is not meant for children.  It could serve as a gentle introduction to the idea of Female Genital Mutilation or as a lesson in human rights to middle school students.  There is an after word by the author including more facts about FGM and an invitation for kids to email her their thoughts.  I would be interested in the sorts of emails she has gotten.

Williams-Garcia borders on overly didactic, but the tone of the book and the friendship between Akilah and Victoria save it from becoming overly so.

I highly recommend this book to girls age 12 and up."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,Working through training with one of our dogs and this is perfect. Flexible plastic makes it a bit more comfortable and it's easy to get on and off. With training methods our dog is getting used to it more and tolerating it on for longer periods of time. Also about $10 cheaper from Amazon than Petco.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"First impression: This is a tiny mesh bag, I bet they sent me the wrong size.

Then, once unfolded: This is a huge towel! Way bigger than a standard shower towel. Its about the size of a big beach towel. A BIG beach towel.
Then: It feels soft, but quite thin.
Then: Kind of an odd feel when you are toweling off (I used it after a swim)...in part because it lacks that certain degree of heft you have come to expect from a towel, and in part because it has a microfiber ""tackiness"" for lack of a better word. If you have ever dried your hands on a microfiber cloth, you know what I mean.

Finally: overall, it is a very absorbent, very soft, very well-made towel. Absolutely perfect for a gym bag because it packs down to the size of a water bottle."
Pet_Supplies_5,1,This crate is absolutely beautiful.  It is a very comfortable crate and easy to move around.  The bottom is adjustable and the front is solid and clear.  There are a lot of nice color options and it is a good value for the price.I bought this for my dog who is a chewer and I love the fact that she can be a little bit lazy so I could take her to the vet with me.  I'm really glad I did.  I love that she gets to take her medications before going to the vet.  This is a little pricey but it's a great price and the price is great too!

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,"I just received this pot and it is the best. I will be purchasing more!Very pretty.I bought this for a friend, and she is a very tall woman. She is very pleased with it. It looks good in her bed. I would recommend this to anyone.I bought this to put in my closet to store things in. It's a nice size and has great storage for my bags. I have a lot of closet storage and this one fits well in the trunk of the closet. It is easy to install. I use it everyday for my laundry. I have a lot of laundry and it is easy to put together"
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"Our cats are on a grain-free diet and also cannot eat dry food so I think this is a healthier treat for them.  Two out of three of our cats will practically do hand-stands for these treats.  (The third cat does not like treats in general.)  When my finicky-but treat-loving cat won't eat his food, we crumble one or two of these on top like it was salt or pepper and it gets him to eat."
Toys_and_Games_5,1,Great Value!!! Worth the price. My daughter loves this!Very good quality. My son loves this!Great quality and great price! I am a huge fan of Tootle.

Movies_and_TV_5,0,"I have worshiped Invader Zim ever since the day it was born and I have two tapes of recorded episodes that I use to draw the characters and decorate my room. When I found out that it was coming out on DVD (Only like a month ago), I almost cried with joy. This is truly a wonderful TV show, animated or not, and it's finally getting the attention it deserves. Zim, the overly determined and somewhat crazy invader who just wants to prove himself worthy in a world where he is isolated, can be compared to many of us who are just trying to make our mark on the world. Gir, the lovable and fun-loving little robot, is like the child that lives within each of us. Dib's obsessive beliefs and theories relate to the things that we try to hold on to in the chaos we call reality. And Gaz is the anti-social, shadow-loving girl who we can relate to on really annoying days when people won't leave us alone."
Books_5,1,"To compare this book to some of the other books in the series, this is the first one to be read.  The second one is also very different.  It is very much like the first one.  It is a story of one man's journey to a faraway land with no hope.  And it is told in a very different way than the first one.  It is very much a journey of discovery.  The two men are all unique, very different people.  They are all young men, they are all vulnerable, they all have a place in the world and a place to be.  And they all have a way of relating to each other and their people.  They all have a place to live and a place to be.

This is a very touching story about life, love, friendship, sacrifice and struggle.  And it is written in a very well written style.  It is a very beautiful story, a story that is not only true, but also poignant.

I received a copy of this book from the publisher for review purposes.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,1,"It's super cute! The only problem is the straps are a little tight around my waist. I'm 5'6"" and the front of the shirt is a little tight around my waist. The only thing I can do is cut it a bit. If it was a bit tighter I would definitely recommend it. I have a narrow chest and I can't wear it with a bra underneath. I wish I would have gotten it a little wider. The shirt was very soft and very comfortable."
Kindle_Store_5,0,Heartwarming story of survival and love. Well written with dialogue that just flows. Strong lovable characters that you want to read about again and again.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,"These are ok for the price. The only problem is that they are small, I have one in my hand and the other in my pocket. The ring itself is a bit loose and that means it won't fit in the pocket. If you are going to use it for hiking, you can get a smaller one. I did get a size large and it fit perfectly. I also got a small for my son and it was a little small for"

Electronics_5,0,This right angle viewfinder was purchased at my husband's request.  It arrived on time and just as described.
Books_5,0,I love this whole series and Ward's writing.  This one has left me hanging more than usual.  Is Jo going to be a vamp/who will she love/how is this going to bring in the reporter boss?  How is Tohr going to find out about his brother and will he end up being a brother?  So many many more questions.  I will be waiting impatiently got the next (with a bit of hope that some of this will be answered in the newer Black Dagger Series).

Toys_and_Games_5,1,"My son got this for Christmas and it was very well received. He loves the detail and the colors. He is very happy with it and the game is a great way to teach him to think and learn. I would recommend it. This was a gift for my niece. She loves it!  I did get a free item and it is a great gift. We love this set. It's a great size for our little one. The basket is very sturdy. My son loves the little items he can put in it. It is a very sturdy set. It is easy to put together, it is not as big as a lot of the other sets out there. The pieces are made of solid plastic. I would recommend it. This is a great little train set."

I enjoyed reading this book and highly recommend it to anyone who likes paranormal romance"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"I usually have arch support issues, but I tried one pair of Merrells in the past and was pleasantly surprised at how great of an arch support they had. I took a chance on buying another pair, and these also fit perfectly. So I quickly bought another pair of Merrells in a different style. They also fit great."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"I purchased the Pro Ears for three tasks - shooting, bow hunting, and working around the yard. So far they have performed well at all three. Shooting noise is effectively blocked out and I can carry on normal conversation at the range. When I'm bow hunting, I can turn up the volume so I can hear every noise in the woods. I actually use them the most mowing and running the weed eater and leaf blower. I connect to my ipod or iphone to listen to my favorite shows while working. Overall quality is excellent and my hope these will preserve the hearing I have left."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"It fits and I like it but the sides are cut in a V so it does not hold in any extra you might have under your arm. I also prefer another bra I purchased for post surgery that has straps that hook in the front as opposed to having a metal in cloth slide bar like this bra. Overall it's okay fo rpost surgical wear, but there are others that are better."

Movies_and_TV_5,0,"This is a strong production filled with beautiful and dramatic singing, and Wixell's playing a dual role tightens the story. Some artistic lapses in the directing are made up for by the exceptional final act."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,I am a huge fan of the Taurus and these Taurus G17s are a great deal.  I had a friend who was a lifetime member and wanted to take it on a trip and had no issues
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"I'm pretty handy, but this was impossible to use, and you'll live in mortal fear it may retract quick enough to slice open your hand. To be clear, it didn't cut me, but it retracts fast enough I believe it could."
Kindle_Store_5,0,At first I wasn't sure I was going to finish the book. However after sorting all the characters and their secrets out it became much more interesting. Some parts of the roles of slaves and mistreatment. Civil war fear combines two families by marriage in a wagon train  too Colorado with their slaves. A  arranged marriage of a son and daughter of the  plantation  white families is made suddenly before leaving.  Love interest that is forbidden grow during the travel.

Toys_and_Games_5,0,"We have been so excited to test out our new kite since it arrived a few days ago.  The weather finally cooperated today, and we were able to take it out for a test run.  First of all, this kite came packaged exceptionally well.  The entire kite is very impressive and includes everything you need, complete with a stunning kite, string (with a dispenser), directions, a spare cross piece, spare connectors,and a spare tail.  The kite looks stunning in the air, and even after a few dips and falls is holding strong.  Best of all, if a piece like a cross piece breaks, we have a spare.

 After having bad luck with kites in the past, I was nervous about trying another kite, but I'm so glad we did.  Finally, a kite we can enjoy, store nicely, and lasts more than a few times.  This kite will last for a long time, and even comes with an exceptional guarantee, the ""Sea-'n'Tree NO-LOSS Guarantee"".  Funny, but amazing!  I am more than impressed with the durability of this kite, and would definitely recommend it.  It's prefect for children and adults.

Product was provided for a fair and honest evaluation."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,1,"It is ok, just not what I expected. Very good quality. Nice bag. Very pretty."
Movies_and_TV_5,0,"I'm going to review this movie for 1 reason only, and it's for the HDR (4k release) content. My opinion on the movie itself is too subjective, and some people just hate Zach Snyder so they won't watch this movie anyways. Anyhow, let's talk about the HDR, and you're buying this for the upgraded visuals. Let me tell you something, the last half of the movie is SIMPLY STUNNING and if you have a newer 4k television with the ability to handle HDR correctly, you'll be in for a visual treat. This is the movie you show to people that have not seen 4k and HDR before, because the colors and contrast pops so much it's stunning. You're literally going to be amazed how bright some objects in the scenes look. Zach Snyder is known for loving his darker scenes, and this movie is very dark in tone and in plot, but then he amazes us with a visual treat when the action  picks up and that dark mood is met with explosions, bright glowing kryptonite, and heat vision eye blasts. If there was a way to capture the image to prove this to you, I would do so and upload it. For now, you need the right type of UHD HDTV that is calibrated and can handle HDR content, and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. The movies for 4k with HDR are lacking right now, and you want to show off? Pick up this title, because even if you aren't a fan of the plot, you WILL be a fan of showing this off to others."
Toys_and_Games_5,0,Great variety.  They will be nice gifts for the kids in our village.
Electronics_5,1,"Didn't get a chance to use it, but it worked perfectly.  I have a few other cameras that are not very good but this one is by far better than the others.I bought this to use in my Kindle Fire HD2.  I have not used it yet but I am considering a 2nd one.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"This bar is great.  I like the dip bars and the high wide grip pull up.  This would be a 5 star product if it had some sort of latch or strap that secures the hanging dip bar.  Otherwise, it will move around a bit."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,Great compact bipod. attaches easily to the rail and stays in place.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,"I cut the strand into 2 pieces and the finish was good.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the design.  The ring is not solid, it's a bit bent and it's not clear how it will bend.  This is a problem for most people and a problem for others.  I also don't have the capacity to cut the rings into 2 pieces.  This is not a problem for me.  I like that the end of the ring is straight and that it's not hard.  I like that it has a ""stiff"" edge.  I like that the end is flat,"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,My son is a surfer and we are on the move in our motorhome. This bag has come in super handy as we transport the surfboard all over the US. The bag is perfect on the Costco surfboard (I'm forgetting the name now - it's the popular one). Anyhow. it works great. it has had much time inside the RV and outside and so far holding up very good. the cost value is the BEST as other bags are so expensive!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"WOW!!!!  Outstanding grabber.  I use this to extend my reach from my wheelchair.  I have purchased a number of different grabbers over the years and most are flimsy and little more that junk.  This grabber, because it is made for grabbing trash and not for disabled use, is ultra sturdy, has great grip strength and will probably outlast me.  The only change I would make if I could, would be to have it 2 or 3 inches shorter.  It was designed for people walking and picking up trash so when I am sitting down, it is just a bit to long."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,This is a great practice net.  My son is 10 and just really starting to learn how to hit and this net is allowing him the extra practice time he needs to get a proper baseball swing down pat.  It is really easy to put up and take down.  I would buy this again in a minute.

Toys_and_Games_5,0,"The Bloco product consists of a few cutout sheets of foam, as well as some connectors. I'll grant that it's clever, and the dragons are fairly neat when fully constructed. That being said, I'm not a huge fan. First of all, there are a large number of pieces - 230 doesn't seem like that much, but many of them are small and even hard to find. My 6 year old was overwhelmed, so I had to piece the things together. Moreover, I suspect that the instruction sheet would be a bit much for a 10 year old, working alone to interpret - let alone a 6 year old. If you look at the picture of the kids on the Bloco page, they still have their baby teeth - so they're marketing to younger kids. The foam itself is, by and large, pretty thick and durable, although there are a couple sheets of thinner form that easily tears as well. In some cases, however, removing the smaller foam holes and pieces can be difficult. Regardless, separating the pieces in the foam sheets took a good amount of effort, and assembling both dragons took around 90 minutes - for an adult. The toy itself was OK. If your child likes Legos they'll probably like this as well. In my case, once the novelty of the newly-built dragons wore off, the toy was largely forgotten. So while the Bloco Dragons are offered at a good price, and some kids will love them, I can't give them an unqualified ""thumbs up."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"Please be aware that this backpack is seriously tiny. It's maybe a foot tall (just slightly taller than my Galaxy 4 phone) and as wide as my phone. This is my mistake since I didn't look at the size when I ordered it.  But it was suprising to see the small amazon box and wonder how they shoved a backpack into it (they didn't...it's little).The comb and mirror included are also itty bitty, but I'm an adult so these are not meant for my giant grown up lady hands.

It's a cute bag, the graphics look crisp, and for the price it's a good deal.

*I bought it for my friend's daughter, who is five. I'll be giving it to her in a few days, and if she likes it/it fits I'll be satisfied

Update: The backpack does indeed fit her, however it's on the loosest setting. She's a skinny little five-year-old, but she's kind of tall. So...I guess take that information as you will. She did like it though, and thought it was cute. I didn't see her use any of the hair things, but she thought the bag was cute and was excited about the hair clips."

Pet_Supplies_5,0,"This is the nutritionally best guinea pig food commercially available (IMHO).  I've done a lot of research over the 20+ years I've been a guinea pig pet-parent and I run a guinea pig enthusiast and informational site.  This is my #1 recommended pelleted food.

I live in a very rural area where guinea pigs as pets are pretty much unheard of so finding a small animal vet for my babies was difficult and we have to drive about 30min to get there.  The vet and one of his technicians are the only people in the county who have taken a 'pig for a checkup and imagine my delight to find out they use and recommend the brand I was already using: Oxbow.

I used this brand for my rabbit who lived a healthy 10 years.
Please remember to protect the vitamin content by storing in a dark container in a cool environment.  Sunlight deteriorates the Vit. C which important for 'pig health."

The fit is great, and I can't wait to wear them. I'm a size 10. 5 and they fit great. I love the straps and they look great. I can't wait to wear them for a long time!I bought these shoes for my wife and she loves them. She says they're comfortable, but they have a little saggy on her. I've had these for about a month now and she's been wearing them daily. She said they're soft and comfortable. She says they're comfortable, but I don't think they're comfortable at all. She said they're a bit snug on her foot, but she's happy with them. Love the design and the shoe. They look good on, but not as comfortable as the photo. Very nice looking. I ordered a size bigger than I normally wear and it fit perfect. The color is true to the picture and it's very bright. I'm very pleased with the purchase and I would recommend it.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,"I bought two.  I had an older model and these fit perfectly.  They are slightly larger and heavier than the old ones.  I also bought the T-10 version.  The old one had a smaller head and a narrower head.  This one is still the same size.  The T-10 version is heavier and heavier than the older one.  The T-10 is just as bright as the T-10 and the T-10 is brighter than the older one.  I would recommend these to anyone.  I will update this review as I receive them.

Pros:
-Great price

It has 2 pocket  for cash and a zippered area for coins. There is also a checkbook slot and another slot.  There  are 12 slots for debit  and credit cards. It is lined with beige paisley  fabric.  I believe  it comes in several colors. I ordered a pale pink. The leather is smooth and soft.
I received this item at a discount  for my honest and unbiased  review."
Kindle_Store_5,1,"It is important to know that the author does not try to appeal to the masses. Instead, the story is told from the point of view of the reader. This is a very interesting premise. It is hard to imagine a book that would be better if it was written from the point of view of a young woman. I found it difficult to connect with the characters at all. I could not connect with the characters at all. I could not connect with the main characters. I could not connect"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,"I bought these in the last couple of weeks and they are perfect. They have a nice grainy appearance and the finish is nice. I also like the fact that the sides are made of a metal material and not plastic. I would recommend them for anyone with an occasional rustic kitchen. I bought this as a gift and it has been great!  It is a little heavier than I expected but it works!  I used it to make a batch of a New England coffee for my son to make into a couple of quickies. He is very pleased with the design and the quality. I am happy with it and will buy it again. This is a very good, thick cover for my pillow. I don't know if it would be worth it to keep it at a room temperature, but I have it on my mattress with no problems. I wish it had a small, low profile cover that was just right for my husband to put on his pillow for a few minutes of sleep."

I did an elimination diet with them and found out they're both sensitive to chicken.

They are both at a healthy weight, too, which is unusual for older small dogs. I highly recommend this food!"

Movies_and_TV_5,0,"The premise of this story, an attractive successful adult ""aged"" single female going after a feloniously enslaved compounded with new baby high school male encounter is preposterous.  Even admits to her parents that she has an All Co Hell problem.  Major impetus was the terminal nature of her original successes writing ""young adult"" (i.e. teeny bopper) novels, which in All Co Hell impaired *teeny bopper* fashion she treats as the end of the world.  ""I think you should leave"" is what she got from her target after having been invited to a baby naming party at the direction of the target's *wife*.  The whole story reminded me of the recent 2015 Jana Kramer C&W song ""I Got the Boy, She Got the Man"".  Too much involved in her own high school level fictional writings to complete evolving her own adult personality.  Well enough acted, photographed, and produced to maintain a three star rating."
Kindle_Store_5,1,I am glad that I read this book. It is a great book for a beginner to start. I read this book in the last few days and have enjoyed it.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"I was really impressed with the bag when I received it and packed it out.  Took it to the range the first time with one rifle and magazines in the pouches.  Great storage, nice internal securing straps, easy to handle and overall great protection.

On the second trip I added the second rifle in the other main compartment side (compartment has divider) and thought what a great space saver this was.  Two guns one bag and all my magazines in the external pockets.  The bag has some cool back pack straps, in the next few seconds I realized how weak the stitching and hardware was.  When I hefted the bag to the first shoulder strap it immediately gave and way and fell to the ground.  It simply could not handle the weight.  The bag has four d-rings that accept two clips from each shoulder strap.  After inspection the d-ring ripped right off the bag, all stitching was pulled out.

Wow I was upset.  I really loved the bag and realized the d-rings are undersized in diameter and their opening in my opinion is too large, very small diameter and the weight is point loaded because the straps twist under the weight, very sloppy,  Even with great stitching it is a  poor design.  Definitely the Achilles Heel of the bag after more thorough inspection.

I like the bag so much I contemplating upgrading and having it better stitched.  Then I realized I did not want to put the money into something to fix poor quality.  It could have been a bad stitching job but I don't want to risk.  It is not easy repacking and returning, waiting for credit or replacement.  Think I will cut my loses and try another brand."

If you are using a pebble time, be cautious with Nato watch bands. 1, they cover the charging port 2. They have a tendency to damage the lockup mechanism. Just be cautious.

I did not like that there were zero instructions and I had to go online to find a walkthrough on how to install a Nato Band from a third party. The included parts kit was nice.

Here's a tip: I noticed she was really chewing on the end, so I tied a knot there to discourage her from tearing it off and ingesting it.  Then the felt actually acquired a couple more knots from how quickly I was waving it over the next few days.  The knots add to the appeal, making a bit of noise and giving her something more substantial to catch and chew on!"

It serves the purpose, however, it has to be treated very gently, being careful not to break the plastic hinges or to have bottles flying around when pulling out the drawers.

I liked it, I just didn't love it. I felt like they should have tried together long before, like they were not super strong characters. Something was missing for me.

Frankly, I find I don't eat anything that requires them:  I eat sushi with chopsticks, and never items that are small or medium nuggets served very hot - hot wings or fried fish straight from the pan, for example.  They're not hard to manipulate, but I don't think I'd reorder or offer for guests to use."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"I'm a bit late with this review. I've had this watch for almost 2 years and I love  it!! I had been wanting a white ceramic watch for the longest time. I wanted a Michael Kors one but I always hear how delicate they are and you have to be extra cautious with them- the slightest slam on a surface will make it break. My aunt got this watch with the Rose Gold frame and she wears it daily with no problems so I got myself one. Even though this watch is much cheaper than an MK watch it's so durable and worth it. I haven't had any problems with the quality.
The only negative thing I have to say is I have had for less than 2 years and I had to get the battery changed once but I figure it's been running since before I purchased it so it's a minor complaint. I just got it changed within the month so I'll see if it's lasts more than 2 years this time like it should."

However, all the vehicles were broken or lost besides the one I managed to rig up for a while.  I set out to find replacement cars and could not.  So buying this was the next best thing.

Let me tell you...my son absolutely loves this set.  In fact, he didn't stop playing with it for the entire first day he had it.  It seems well-made taking the price into account.  The track length is actually perfect considering I use the other one simultaneously. The cars have a lot of ""get up and go"", as well.

I am most impressed with the inclusion of extra parts.  I'd read reviews on Amazon before purchasing this set that complained about issues with the tire treads...When I opened the box, I found several replacement treads among other extras.  The track is easy for me to assemble and dis-assemble, but not for my two year old.

The set I received actually had a few additional parts to the track not shown in the picture, which adds to the fun!

I'm worried about the cars being damaged because my son is a bit rough with them and there seems to be no way to replace just the vehicles if this does happen. So that annoys me, but overall I'm very pleased with this purchase and my son didn't stop smiling...My 9-year-old god son likes it, as well!!"

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"I'm not one of those fortunate people that have a lot of garage space and a big truck to haul a ladder around in so this works perfectly. It feels flimsy but works well. I can now get into my teeny tiny indoor attic opening. Dropped one star because it feels flimsy, although I've had no problems with it holding my weight. Dropped another star because of the danger factor. Be very careful when lowering this ladder. Keep your hands under the switches or a trip to the hospital for a smashed finger/hand may be in order."

Books_5,0,"After watching the Sharpe series on video I decided to read them in print.  Bernard Cornwell wrote this book first, although chronologically it is not the first in the life of Richard Sharpe.  What a great story!  It has all the elements of a great adventure.  This book is a page-turner from the very beginning.  This is a great book for the history buff - or anyone who loves an adventure.  One of the things I like about Bernard Cornwell's Sharpe books is that they are great stand alone stories and you don't feel that you need to read the entire series in a particular order to enjoy them.  I have bought several copies of Sharpe's Eagle and given them as presents to those hard-to-buy-for men on my shopping lists."

The cord is very long so vacuuming large pieces of furniture and even carpets is convenient.  It is easy to empty and clean.  One star detracted because as other reviewers have noted, the placement of the vents does cause debris/fur to fly everywhere if you're not careful."

Disappointed to find out that it isn't a stand alone tent.  Not Amazons fault, it clearly states one pole, I just didn't think about it meaning that it wouldnt stand alone. Makes it very difficult for an 11 year old to set up by himself. Past the return window, so we will just have to keep it. Seems like a good tent, and we like how the fly goes to the ground.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"So glad I bought this.  Went on vacation and came back at night time on a rainy day.  My basement drain was backing water up into my basement. , it was about 8"" high by the drain and it was just getting higher and higher - luckily my basement is sloped and not much damage was done.  Immediately I pulled this pump out and set it up to use it my first time.  Attached both hoses that I got for it, filled the top with water and put the strainer on the hose that I put into the water.  Immediately it started pumping water at a decent rate outside.  This kept the water level down (in fact, it drained all of it in about 1.5 hours) until I could get to Home Depot the next morning to rent a power snake and clear the clog.  If I didn't have this my only choice would have been to call a plumber late at night on a Friday and pay ridiculous fees for an emergency visit."

It comes with a lightweight wood tray, which can either be used with the tealights, or with something else. Their are 9 tealight holders, in the set, of varying heights, colors and textures. The great thing is, since there are 9 tealight holders, you could actually break them up and use some in other areas too. Also, you could either use real tealight candles, or you could do like I did, and order a battery operated set, with timers, also found on Amazon, and place those inside, so they would come on automatically every night, and then all you have to do is periodically change the batteries. These tealight holders are also great on a window, where they catch the light. If you have a bathroom with a tub, by they window, they would be great on the window ledge, where they would catch the light, during the day, and could be used for ambiance, when taking a bath."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,0,"This review is for the Ekouaer Womens Satin Robe Wedding Party Wear (Red, XL).

This nightgown is elegant, classic and feminine. I got the red color, the red was a little brighter than I expected but really very lovely. I also purchased the XL size. I am a size 12/14 and it does fit but its a little small. If you are a larger then a size 14 this will NOT completely tie closed. It does tie closed on me, but its open in at the bottom and doesnt completely wrap like its supposed to.

The fabric is a beautiful, soft red satin. This does need ironing so if you are traveling with it, pack a travel steamer. I think its because the fabric is so delicate. Despite the fabric being so satiny, this is NOT see through, so if you are wearing your bra and panties underneath you cant see them when its completely closed.

The lace detail is amazing, the neckline has THICK bandings of lace sewn down the front, the sleeves have lace trim and it goes up into the sleeve to give it some design flare. The lace is white or slightly off white, but it is VERY QUALITY lace and not unraveling, falling off or threatening to tear at any part. In fact, the craftsmanship and detail of this robe on a whole is VERY well made, this is something you would pay a lot of money for at the higher end retail stores. If you like delicate lingerie that is classy and makes you look good, try this robe out and you will enjoy it! 5/5 stars

It is hard to get the pieces in the box. My daughter is still waiting for her first birthday party. She's a huge fan of the show and the kids love to play with it. I just wish there was more to it. Great. I like that the pieces are very small and have a nice twist. The smaller pieces are nice and easy to store. My 5 year old has found the smaller pieces are difficult to put together and not as sturdy. I would definitely buy this again. Very nice item. I bought this for my 9 year old for Christmas and he was obsessed with it. It's very cool and sturdy and he loves it. We had to go back to the original and put the pieces back together. It was a little pricey for a 5 year old and the price was a lot lower than we paid for it. I don't know if it's a quality issue, but it's a nice little toy. This is a great card for all my kids to have in their deck. The colors are vibrant and my kids love them. I like that there is a lot of cards that can be played with. My daughter loves this little train set!  It's a good size for a little child to play with. My 2 year old daughter loves this train set. It's very easy to assemble. It's fun for little hands.

Swank plays an astronaut who along with Bruce Greenwood must pilot Virgil, a craft designed to burrow (with the assistance of one really mean laser beam) to the earth's core in an attempt to correct an imbalance that was doing serious damage to the surface above.
Also along on this unbelievable trip to the earth's center are  respectable performers in stereotypical roles: Aaron Eckhart (the voyage's ""studly"" college professor), Alfre Woodard (mission commander), Delroy Lindo (the ship's inventor and symbol of self-sacrifice), Stanley Tucci (the despicable scientific genius with a hidden agenda), and Richard Jenkins as the mysterious military hardliner.

The widow, Lilith Davenant, never knew affection before, or during her marriage.  That has remained unchanged since her wastrel husband's demise.  She is thought of as one icy, stiff, no nonsense lady of high principles and morals.

A wager has been agreed upon whereby the Marquess of Brandon/Julian must seduce the newly betrothed and aloof Lilith within six weeks.  This in order to remove his cousin, Lord Robert, from the clutches of his conniving mistress and avoid family scandal.  And so the games begin.

This is an enjoyable read, but not Ms. Chase's best.  It was quite predictable.  And, although it being quite appropriate for the times and Lilith's moral character, I would have liked at least one full sex scene between the H/h.  I would also have liked an epilogue."

Fits the Howard Leight Set and the audio cable perfectly, with additional room for a set of batteries. Case and zipper seem sturdy and made to last, and has a convenient hand strap included.

Dan gets this opportunity to beat certain fate and make it up with his presence, and it's a race against time to get what he intended within those seven hours.
Our time on earth is limited. We all die at some point, and Mike Dellosso wakes you up to the fact of this limit of life. Once you grasp that, he paints a story that it's not what's behind you that counts, its about being intentional and forward thinking to the relationships that matter most in each precious moment we are granted here that matters. And once you realize this in the story, the pages turn very quickly as you hope against each obstacle Mike writes to see if Dan can get it done.
Despite your best guessing you won't predict the end, but it will leave you choked up and reconsidering your seven hours left. Even though you don't know when Thomas Constant sets your timer.
Time is ticking...."

I didn't notice so much with the characters from the medical examiner's office in New York because most of them have been in other Cook novels I've read.

This book puts you back in the drivers seat and empowers you to believe you can have power back over your body. I read this book after reading Grain Brain and the two work nicely together. The book explains the genetic manipulation of wheat and the deterioration correlation with our health. It briefly talks about how food intolerances fit into it all. I would have liked more information on this and candida, but over all you finish the book knowing exactly what to do. There is a reference in the book to Taubes, Why We Get Fat and What to Do About It. I highly recommend this book for more research and to just hammer that last nail in the carb coffin."

But these white ones are much shorter probably 1/4 - 1/2"" shorter in the toes. So my toes are a little cramped. The bad thing about it was that I had already worn them out and about in town before I realized that they were so much smaller so I didn't really feel comfortable sending them back after wearing them for 4 or 5 hours. I  sure wish that I could have swapped them for a 9 wide but it is too late now because I have tried to tough it out and wear them anyway this week. But I will know next time to make sure that the shoe fits very well when I first put them on. I had a stroke 13 years ago and these are the only style shoe that I can wear now. Since they slide on and off so easily they are a great shoe for me to wear! I absolutely love these shoes!!!!"

I also use them to wash my nails and they do not stain. I have a hard time cleaning them because they have a rough texture. I have a hard time with drying them, but I do use them daily. They are great for my hands, but I can't say how much they do. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. This is a great pillow for a few bucks or more. It is sturdy, but very comfortable for a bed. It does not look like it was made out of plastic. It is a nice looking pillow, but not for a single person. I love this crockpot!  It is easy to clean, it is easy to use, and it is easy to clean!  I would recommend it to anyone!I have a cup of coffee every morning and this was perfect!  It made my morning coffee perfect!

The first book in the series, the Bride of the Bride, is the first of the three in the series. It is told from the perspective of a young woman. This book is a great introduction to the story. It is a quick read and will make you feel the emotions of the characters.

The main characters, Cara and Ethan, are on a journey with a group of people who have been close to each other for years. They have been together since they were little. They have a great connection, but have a different way of talking about it. They have a lot of issues, but they are able to overcome them.

This book is about Cara and Ethan. Cara is a single mom, Ethan is a single father who is raising a son in a small town. Cara is a single mom who is dealing with a loss. Ethan is a single father who is dealing with a divorce and a lot of guilt. Cara and Ethan have a connection that is going to be hard for them to forget.

After a little work, I was able to install Ubuntu on this drive and dual-boot between Linux and Windows 8.1.  Booting into Linux is super fast, even compared to regular Linux boot times.

For anyone else looking to do the dual-boot trick, the key is to use the most recent version of Ubuntu (the older versions don't play well with the Windows UEFI boot loader) and make sure you disable the Secure Boot option in your BIOS.  Also, turn off the Fast Startup in Windows 8 if you want to be able to access your Windows partition from Linux, otherwise Windows just hibernates instead of doing a complete shut down."

I'm not a doctor and I just read the book, so I haven't yet started the program, but McWayne has a very logical and well thought out approach that is clear, concise and appears to be quite effective. And McWayne  matches his simple approach to weight loss --  based on psychological principles and medical research -- with obvious passion that should help get you started on the program.

Mudd is a film that is the most emotional, heart-wrenching and heartbreaking film I have ever seen.  It is a film that is on the cusp of making a profound impact on the lives of people who are not only gay, but who are also people who are just as flawed and loved by their families.  This film is a film that can only be seen in the context of the lives of these people, and to them, and to the rest of us, as a film that has the power to change lives.

This film is a film that is about people's courage to stand up and speak out against violence and abuse.  It is a film that is about how people can make a difference, but also how they can live life without it.  This film is a film that is about the courage to be brave, and not just about the courage to be brave.  It is a film that is about how we can make a difference, and not just about the courage to live life without it.

Toys_and_Games_5,0,"When the MH dolls first came out I thought. ""With the way they pop on and off, why not do them all like this and make them interchangeable?""  yeah great idea right?  No, not when Mattel is being greedy. I made the mistake of buying almost everyone of these kits. God Help Me!  I got completely ripped off. They are cheap, the wigs look like crap, the arms and legs are loose, and the hip joints break with little movement. I cant believe that Mattel has gotten so cheap. I mean first the first set of MH dolls end up breaking like crazy, then this?  Come on Mattel don't you have enough money????? Do you really have to rip off us parents this close to Christmas????  This set was NOT worth the money, and I didn't pay hardly anything for it at the store. None of these sets are worth a flip. I might as well toss them ALL in the trash or had just set my dollars on fire in the store. I will be very cautious in buying ANYTHING new from Mattel that is MH. So parents just beware. If you buy any of these kits just know that you are getting half of what you pay for, if that. What is next?  A pile of crap with the MH logo on it?  Really Mattel, really?  This set is even worse than the others and I bought them all unfortunately! The wings won't stay on, none of the torsos look good with any of it. The wig is cheapy, it looks like crap. the dress looks like it is cheap and it isn't even. The velcro is off to the side and you can see it from the front. It just looks terrible. The legs and arms, like all of the others, won't stay on. So just save your money, just wait for the real doll."

The basic premise of the story is that a young man is kidnapped by a police force, and one of the men is still there.  In the meantime, the police force is losing its moral compass, and it is up to him to save the day.  The story is a bit weak on the feet of a good director, but it's still a fun twist on the series.

Love it!This is a very good story with good acting.  The premise is pretty simple, but the story is pretty funny.  I recommend this movie to anyone with a heart.
